## List columns with `tidyr`

### Nesting data

It may become necessary to indicate the groups of a tibble in a somewhat more explicit way than simply using `dplyr::group_by`. `tidyr` offers the option to create nested tibbles, that is, to store complex objects in the columns of a tibble. This includes other tibbles, as well as model objects and plots.

*NB:* Nesting data is done using `tidyr::nest`, which is different from the similarly named `tidyr::nesting`.

The example below shows how _Phylacine_ data can be converted into a nested tibble.

```{r}
# get phylacine data
data = read_csv("data/phylacine_traits.csv")
data = data %>% 
  `colnames<-`(str_to_lower(colnames(.))) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(str_remove(colnames(.), "(.1.2)")) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(str_replace_all(colnames(.), "\\.", "_"))

```


```{r}
# nest phylacine by order
nested_data = data %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  nest()

nested_data

# get column class
sapply(nested_data, class)
```

The data is now a nested data frame. The class of each of its columns is respectively, a character (order name) and a list (the data of all mammals in the corresponding order).

While `nest` can be used without first grouping the tibble, it's just much easier to group first.

### Unnesting data

A nested tibble can be converted back into the original, or into a processed form, using `tidyr::unnest`. The original groups are retained.

```{r}
# use unnest to recover the original data frame
unnest(nested_data, cols = "data") %>% 
  head()

# unnesting preserves groups
groups(unnest(nested_data, cols = "data"))
```

The `unnest_longer` and `unnest_wider` variants of `unnest` are maturing functions, that is, not in their final form. They allow interesting variations on unnesting --- these are shown here but advised against.
Unnest the data first, and then convert it to the form needed.

### Working with list columns

The class of a list column is `list`, and working with list columns (and lists, and list-like objects such as vectors)  makes iteration necessary, since this is one of the only ways to operate on lists.

Two examples are shown below when getting the class and number of rows of the nested tibbles in the list column.

```{r}
# how many rows in each nested tibble?
for (i in seq_along(nested_data$data[1:10])) {
  print(nrow(nested_data$data[[i]]))
}

# what is the class of each element?
lapply(X = nested_data$data[1:3], FUN = class)
```

### Functionals {-}

The second example uses `lapply`, and this is a _functional_. _Functionals_ are functions that take another function as one of their arguments. Base `R` functionals include the `*apply` family of functions: `apply`, `lapply`, `vapply` and so on.

## Iteration with `map`

The `tidyverse` replaces traditional loop-based iteration with _functionals_ from the `purrr` package. 

#### Why use `purrr` {-}

A good reason to use `purrr` functionals instead of base `R` functionals is their consistent and clear naming, which always indicates how they should be used. This is explained in the examples below. How `map` is different from `for` and `lapply` are best explained in the **[Advanced R Book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html)**.

### Basic use of `map`

`map` works very similarly to `lapply`, where `.x` is object on whose elements to apply the function `.f`.

```{r}
# get the number of rows in data
map(.x = nested_data$data, .f = nrow) %>% 
  head()
```

`map` works on any list-like object, which includes vectors, and always returns a list. `map` takes two arguments, the object on which to operate, and the function to apply to each element.

```{r}
# get the square root of each integer 1 - 10
some_numbers = 1:3
map(some_numbers, sqrt)
```

### `map` variants returning vectors

Though `map` always returns a list, it has variants named `map_*` where the suffix indicates the return type. 
`map_chr`, `map_dbl`, `map_int`, and `map_lgl` return character, double (numeric), integer, and logical vectors.

```{r}
# use map_dbl to get the mean mass in each order
map_dbl(nested_data$data, function(df){
  mean(df$mass_g)
})

# map_chr will convert the output to a character
# here we get the most common IUCN status of each order
map_chr(nested_data$data, function(df){
  
  count(df, iucn_status) %>% 
    arrange(-n) %>% 
    summarise(common_status = first(iucn_status)) %>% 
    pull(common_status)
})

# map_lgl returns TRUE/FALSE values
some_numbers = c(NA, 1:3, NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf)
map_lgl(some_numbers, is.na)
```

### `map` variants returning data frames

`map_df` returns data frames, and by default binds dataframes by rows, while `map_dfr` does this explicitly, and `map_dfc` does returns a dataframe bound by column.

```{r}
# get the first two rows of each dataframe
map_df(nested_data$data[1:3], head, n = 2)
```

`map` accepts arguments to the function being mapped, such as in the example above, where `head()` accepts the argument `n = 2`.

`map_dfr` behaves the same as `map_df`.

```{r}
# the same as above but with a pipe
nested_data$data[1:5] %>% 
  map_dfr(head, n = 2)
```

`map_dfc` binds the resulting 3 data frames of two rows each by column, and automatically repairs the column names, adding a suffix to each duplicate.

### Working with list columns using `map`

The various `map` versions integrate well with list columns to make synthetic/summary data. In the example, the `dplyr::mutate` function is used to add three columns to the nested tibble: the number of rows, the mean mileage, and the name of the first car.

In each of these cases, the vectors added are generated using `purrr` functions.

```{r}
# get the number of rows per dataframe, the mean mileage, and the first car
nested_data = nested_data %>%
  mutate(
    # use the int return to get the number of rows
    n_rows = map_int(data, nrow),
    
    # double return for mean mileage
    mean_mass = map_dbl(data, function(df) {mean(df$mass_g)}),
    
    # character return to get the heaviest member
    first_animal = map_chr(data, function(df) {
      arrange(df, -mass_g) %>% 
        .$binomial %>% 
        first()}
    )
  )

# examine the output
nested_data
```

### Selective mapping using `map` variants

`map_at` and `map_if` work like other `*_at` and `*_if` functions. Here, `map_if` is used to run a linear model only on those tibbles which have sufficient data. The predicate is specified by `.p`.

In this example, the nested tibble is given a new column using `dplyr::mutate`, where the data to be added is a mixed list.

```{r}
# split data by order number and run an lm only if there are more than 100 rows
nested_data = nest(data, data = -order)

nested_data = mutate(nested_data,
              model = map_if(.x = data,
                             
                             # this is the predicate
                             # which elements should be operated on?
                             .p = function(x){
                               nrow(x) > 100
                             },
                             
                             # this is the function to use
                             # if the predicate is satisfied
                             .f = function(x){
                               lm(mass_g ~ diet_plant, data = x)
                             }))
# check the data structure
nested_data %>% head()
```

Some elements of the column `model` are tibbles, which have not been operated on because they have fewer than 100 rows (species). The remaining elements are `lm` objects.

## More `map` variants 

`map` also has variants along the axis of how many elements are operated upon. `map2` operates on two vectors or list-like elements, and returns a single list as output, while `pmap` operates on a list of list-like elements.
The output has as many elements as the input lists, which must be of the same length.

### Mapping over two inputs with map2

`map2` has the same variants as `map`, allowing for different return types. 
Here `map2_int` returns an integer vector.

```{r}
# consider 2 vectors and replicate the simple vector addition using map2
map2_int(.x = 1:5, 
         .y = 6:10,
         .f = sum)
```

`map2` doesn't have `_at` and `_if` variants.

One use case for `map2` is to deal with both a list element and its index, as shown in the example. This may be necessary when the list index is removed in a `split` or `nest`. This can also be done with `imap`, where the index is referred to as `.y`.

```{r}
# make a named list for this example
this_list = list(a = "first letter",
                 b = "second letter")

# a not particularly useful example
map2(this_list, names(this_list),
     function(x, y) {
       glue::glue('{x} : {y}')
     })

# imap can also do this
imap(this_list,
     function(x, .y){
       glue::glue('{x} : {.y}')
     })
```

### Mapping over multiple inputs with pmap

`pmap` instead operates on a list of multiple list-like objects, and also comes with the same return type variants as `map`. The example shows both aspects of `pmap` using `pmap_chr`.

```{r}
# operate on three different lists
list_01 = as.list(1:3)
list_02 = as.list(letters[1:3])
list_03 = as.list(rainbow(3))

# print a few statements
pmap_chr(list(list_01, list_02, list_03),
         function(l1, l2, l3){
           glue::glue('number {l1}, letter {l2}, colour {l3}')
         })
```

## Combining map variants and tidyverse functions

The example below shows a relatively complex data manipulation pipeline.
Such pipelines must either be thought through carefully in advance, or checked for required output on small subsets of data, so as not to consume excessive system resources.

In the pipeline:

1. The tibble becomes a nested dataframe by order (using `tidyr::nest`),
2. If there are enough data points (> 100), a linear model of mass ~ plant diet is fit (using `purrr::map_if`, and `stats::lm`),
3. The model coefficients are extracted if the model was fit (using `purrr::map` & `dplyr::case_when`),
4. The model coefficients are converted to data for plotting (using `purrr::map`, `tibble::tibble`, & `tidyr::pivot_wider`),
5. The raw data is plotted along with the model fit, taking the title from the nested data frame (using `purrr::pmap` & `ggplot2::ggplot`).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nested_data <-
  data %>% 
  tidyr::nest(data = -order) %>% 
  mutate(data,
         model = map_if(.x = data,
                        
                        # this is the predicate
                        # which elements should be operated on?
                        .p = function(x){
                          nrow(x) > 100
                        },
                        
                        # this is the function to use
                        # if the predicate is satisfied
                        .f = function(x){
                          lm(mass_g ~ diet_plant, data = x)
                        })) %>% 
  
  mutate(m_coef = map(model,
                      
                      # use case when to get model coefficients
                      function(x) {
                        dplyr::case_when(
                          "lm" %in% class(x) ~ {
                            list(coef(x))
                          },
                          TRUE ~ {
                            list(c(NA,NA))
                          }
                        )}), 
         
         # work on the two element double vector of coefficients
         m_coef = map(m_coef, function(x){
           tibble(coef = unlist(x),
                  param = c("intercept", "diet_plant")) %>% 
             pivot_wider(names_from = "param",
                         values_from = "coef")
         }),
         
         # work on the raw data and the coefficients
         plot = pmap(list(order, data, m_coef), function(ord, x, y){
           
           # pay no attention to the ggplot for now
           ggplot2::ggplot()+
             geom_point(data = x,
                        aes(diet_plant, mass_g),
                        size = 0.1)+
             scale_y_log10()+
             labs(title = glue::glue('order: {ord}'))
         })
  )
```

## A return to map variants

Lists are often nested, that is, a list element may itself be a list. It is possible to map a function over elements as a specific depth.

In the example, phylacine is split by order, and then by IUCN status, creating a two-level list, with the second layer operated on.

```{r}
# use map to make a 2 level list
this_list = split(data, data$order) %>% 
  map(function(df){ split(df, df$iucn_status) })

# map over the second level to count the number of 
# species in each order in each IUCN class
# display only the first element
map_depth(this_list[1], 2, nrow)
```

### Iteration without a return

`map` and its variants have a return type, which is either a list or a vector.
However, it is often necessary to iterate a function over a list-like object for that function's side effects, such as printing a message to screen, plotting a series of figures, or saving to file.

`walk` is the function for this task. It has only the variants `walk2`, `iwalk`, and `pwalk`, whose logic is similar to `map2`, `imap`, and `pmap`. In the example, the function applied to each list element is intended to print a message.

```{r}
this_list = split(data, data$order)

iwalk(this_list,
      function(df, .y){
        print(glue::glue('{nrow(df)} species in order {.y}'))
      })
```

### Modify rather than map

When the return type is expected to be the same as the input type, that is, a list returning a list, or a character vector returning the same, `modify` can help with keeping strictly to those expectations.

In the example, simply adding 2 to each vector element produces an error, because the output is a `numeric`, or `double`. `modify` helps ensure some type safety in this way.

```{r}
vec = as.integer(1:10)

tryCatch(
  expr = {
    
    # this is what we want you to look at
    
    modify(vec, function(x) { (x + 2) })
    
  },
  
  # do not pay attention to this
  error = function(e){
    print(toString(e))
  }
)
```

Converting the output to an integer, which was the original input type, serves as a solution.

```{r}
modify(vec, function(x) { as.integer(x + 2) })
```

#### A note on `invoke` {-}

`invoke` used to be a wrapper around `do.call`, and can still be found with its family of functions in `purrr`. It is however retired in favour of functionality already present in `map` and `rlang::exec`, the latter of which will be covered in another session.

## Other functions for working with lists

`purrr` has a number of functions to work with lists, especially lists that are not nested list-columns in a tibble.

### Filtering lists

Lists can be filtered on any predicate using `keep`, while the special case `compact` is applied when the empty elements of a list are to be filtered out. `discard` is the opposite of `keep`, and keeps only elements not satisfying a condition. Again, the predicate is specified by `.p`.

```{r}
# a list containing numbers
this_list = list(a = 1, b = -1, c = 2, d = NULL, e = NA)

# remove the empty element
# this must be done before using keep on the list
this_list = compact(this_list)
```

```{r}
# use discard to remove the NA
this_list = discard(this_list, .p =is.na)

# keep list elements which are positive
keep(this_list, .p = function(x){ x > 0 })
```

`head_while` is bit of an odd case, which returns all elements of a list-like object in sequence until the first one fails to satisfy a predicate, specified by `.p`.

```{r}
1:10 %>% 
  head_while(.p = function(x) x < 5)
```


### Summarising lists

The `purrr` functions `every`, `some`, `has_element`, `detect`, `detect_index`, and `vec_depth` help determine whether a list passes a certain logical test or not. These are seldom used and are not discussed here.

### Reduction and accumulation

`reduce` helps combine elements along a list using a specific function. Consider the example below where list elements are concatenated into a single vector.

```{r}
this_list = list(a = 1:3, b = 3:4, c = 5:10)

reduce(this_list, c)
```

This can also be applied to data frames. Consider some random samples of `mtcars`, each with only 5 cars removed. The objective is to find the cars present in all 10 samples.

The way `reduce` works in the example below is to take the first element and find its intersection with the second, and to take the result and find its intersection with the third and so on.

```{r message=FALSE}
# sample mtcars
mtcars = as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = "car")

sampled_data = map(1:10, function(x){
  sample_n(mtcars, nrow(mtcars)-5)
  })

# get cars which appear in all samples
sampled_data = reduce(sampled_data, 
                      dplyr::inner_join)
```

`accumulate` works very similarly, except it retains the intermediate products. The first element is retained as is. `accumulate2` and `reduce2` work on two lists, following the same logic as `map2` etc.
Both functions can be used in much more complex ways than demonstrated here.

```{r}
# make a list
this_list = list(a = 1:3, b = 3:6, c = 5:10, d = c(1,2,5,10,12))

# a multiple accumulate can help
accumulate(this_list, union, .dir = "forward")
```

### Miscellaneous operation

`purrr` offers a few more functions to work with lists (or list like objects). `prepend` works very similarly to `append`, except it adds to the head of a list. `splice` adds multiple objects together in a list. `splice` will break the existing list structure of input lists.

`flatten` has a similar behaviour, and converts a list of vectors or list of lists to a single list-like object. `flatten_*` options allow the output type to be specified.

```{r}
this_list = list(a = rep("a", 3),
                 b = rep("b", 4))

this_list

# use flatten chr to get a character vector
flatten_chr(this_list)
```

`transpose` shifts the index order in multi-level lists. This is seen in the example, where the `iucn_status` goes from being the index of the second level to the index of the first.

```{r}
this_list = split(data, data$order) %>% 
  map(function(df) {split(df, df$iucn_status)})
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# from a list of lists where species are divided by order and then
# iucn_status, this is now a list of lists where species are 
# divided by status and then order
transpose(this_list[1])
```

## Lists of `ggplots` with `patchwork`

The [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) library helps compose `ggplots`, which will be properly introduced in the next session. `patchwork` usually works on lists of `ggplots`, which can come from a standalone list, or from a list column in a nested dataframe.
The example below shows the latter, with the `data` data frame from earlier.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# use patchwork on list
patchwork::wrap_plots(nested_data$plot[1:5])
```
