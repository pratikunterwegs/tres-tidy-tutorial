Often, such data has to be written to file from within R. readr contains a number of functions to help with reading and writing text files. 1.1.1 Reading data Reading in a csv file with readr is done with the read_csv function, a faster alternative to the base R read.csv. Here, read_csv is applied to the mtcars example. # get the filepath of the example some_example = readr_example(&quot;mtcars.csv&quot;) # read the file in some_example = read_csv(some_example) head(some_example) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 11 #&gt; mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 21 6 160 110 3.9 2.62 16.5 0 1 4 4 #&gt; 2 21 6 160 110 3.9 2.88 17.0 0 1 4 4 #&gt; 3 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.32 18.6 1 1 4 1 #&gt; 4 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.22 19.4 1 0 3 1 #&gt; 5 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.44 17.0 0 0 3 2 #&gt; 6 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.46 20.2 1 0 3 1 The read_csv2 function is useful when dealing with files where the separator between columns is a semicolon ;, and where the decimal point is represented by a comma ,. Other variants include: read_tsv for tab-separated files, and read_delim, a general case which allows the separator to be specified manually. readr import function will attempt to guess the column type from the first N lines in the data. This N can be set using the function argument guess_max. The n_max argument sets the number of rows to read, while the skip argument sets the number of rows to be skipped before reading data. By default, the column names are taken from the first row of the data, but they can be manually specified by passing a character vector to col_names. There are some other arguments to the data import functions, but the defaults usually just work. 1.1.2 Writing data Writing data uses the write_* family of functions, with implementations for csv, csv2 etc. (represented by the asterisk), mirroring the import functions discussed above. write_* functions offer the append argument, which allow a data frame to be added to an existing file. These functions are not covered here. 1.1.3 Reading and writing lines Sometimes, there is text output generated in R which needs to be written to file, but is not in the form of a dataframe. A good example is model outputs. It is good practice to save model output as a text file, and add it to version control. Similarly, it may be necessary to import such text, either for display to screen, or to extract data. This can be done using the readr functions read_lines and write_lines. Consider the model summary from a simple linear model. # get the model model = lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars) The model summary can be written to file. When writing lines to file, BE AWARE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNIX AND WINODWS line separators. Usually, this causes no trouble. # capture the model summary output model_output = capture.output(summary(model)) # save it to file write_lines(x = model_output, path = &quot;model_output.txt&quot;) This model output can be read back in for display, and each line of the model output is an element in a character vector. # read in the model output and display model_output = read_lines(&quot;model_output.txt&quot;) # use cat to show the model output as it would be on screen cat(model_output, sep = &quot;\\n&quot;) #&gt; #&gt; Call: #&gt; lm(formula = mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars) #&gt; #&gt; Residuals: #&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #&gt; -4.543 -2.365 -0.125 1.410 6.873 #&gt; #&gt; Coefficients: #&gt; Estimate Std.

Excel files Finally, data is often shared or stored by well meaning people in the form of Microsoft Excel sheets. Indeed, Excel (especially when synced regularly to remote storage) is a good way of noting down observational data in the field. The readxl package allows importing from Excel files, including reading in specific sheets. 1.2 String manipulation with stringr stringr is the tidyverse package for string manipulation, and exists in an interesting symbiosis with the stringi package. For the most part, stringr is a wrapper around stringi, and is almost always more than sufficient for day-to-day needs. stringr functions begin with str_. 1.2.1 Putting strings together Concatenate two strings with str_c, and duplicate strings with str_dup. Flatten a list or vector of strings using str_flatten. # str_c works like paste(), choose a separator str_c(&quot;this string&quot;, &quot;this other string&quot;, sep = &quot;_&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;this string_this other string&quot; # str_dup works like rep str_dup(&quot;this string&quot;, times = 3) #&gt; [1] &quot;this stringthis stringthis string&quot; # str_flatten works on lists and vectors str_flatten(string = as.list(letters), collapse = &quot;_&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;a_b_c_d_e_f_g_h_i_j_k_l_m_n_o_p_q_r_s_t_u_v_w_x_y_z&quot; str_flatten(string = letters, collapse = &quot;-&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p-q-r-s-t-u-v-w-x-y-z&quot; str_flatten is especially useful when displaying the type of an object that returns a list when class is called on it. # get the class of a tibble and display it as a single string class_tibble = class(tibble::tibble(a = 1)) str_flatten(string = class_tibble, collapse = &quot;, &quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;tbl_df, tbl, data.frame&quot; 1.2.2 Detecting strings Count the frequency of a pattern in a string with str_count. Returns an inteegr. Detect whether a pattern exists in a string with str_detect. Returns a logical and can be used as a predicate. Both are vectorised, i.e, automatically applied to a vector of arguments. # there should be 5 a-s here str_count(string = &quot;ababababa&quot;, pattern = &quot;a&quot;) #&gt; [1] 5 # vectorise over the input string # should return a vector of length 2, with integers 5 and 3 str_count(string = c(&quot;ababbababa&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;), pattern = &quot;a&quot;) #&gt; [1] 5 3 # vectorise over the pattern to count both a-s and b-s str_count(string = &quot;ababababa&quot;, pattern = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)) #&gt; [1] 5 4 Vectorising over both string and pattern works as expected. # vectorise over both string and pattern # counts a-s in first input, and b-s in the second str_count(string = c(&quot;ababababa&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;), pattern = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)) #&gt; [1] 5 1 # provide a longer pattern vector to search for both a-s # and b-s in both inputs str_count(string = c(&quot;ababababa&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;), pattern = c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)) #&gt; [1] 5 1 4 3 str_locate locates the search pattern in a string, and returns the start and end as a two column matrix. # the behaviour of both str_locate and str_locate_all is # to find the first match by default str_locate(string = &quot;banana&quot;, pattern = &quot;ana&quot;) #&gt; start end #&gt; [1,] 2 4 # str_detect detects a sequence in a string str_detect(string = &quot;Bananageddon is coming!&quot;, pattern = &quot;na&quot;) #&gt; [1] TRUE # str_detect is also vectorised and returns a two-element logical vector str_detect(string = &quot;Bananageddon is coming!&quot;, pattern = c(&quot;na&quot;, &quot;don&quot;)) #&gt; [1] TRUE TRUE # use any or all to convert a multi-element logical to a single logical # here we ask if either of the patterns is detected any(str_detect(string = &quot;Bananageddon is coming!&quot;, pattern = c(&quot;na&quot;, &quot;don&quot;))) #&gt; [1] TRUE Detect whether a string starts or ends with a pattern. Also vectorised. Both have a negate argument, which returns the negative, i.e., returns FALSE if the search pattern is detected. # taken straight from the examples, because they suffice fruit &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;pear&quot;, &quot;pineapple&quot;) # str_detect looks at the first character str_starts(fruit, &quot;p&quot;) #&gt; [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE # str_ends looks at the last character str_ends(fruit, &quot;e&quot;) #&gt; [1] TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE # an example of negate = TRUE str_ends(fruit, &quot;e&quot;, negate = TRUE) #&gt; [1] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE str_subset [WHICH IS NOT RELATED TO str_sub] helps with subsetting a character vector based on a str_detect predicate. In the example, all elements containing “banana” are subset. str_which has the same logic except that it returns the vector position and not the elements. # should return a subset vector containing the first two elements str_subset(c(&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;bananageddon is coming&quot;, &quot;applegeddon is not real&quot;), pattern = &quot;banana&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;banana&quot; &quot;bananageddon is coming&quot; # returns an integer vector str_which(c(&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;bananageddon is coming&quot;, &quot;applegeddon is not real&quot;), pattern = &quot;banana&quot;) #&gt; [1] 1 2 1.2.3 Matching strings str_match returns all positive matches of the patttern in the string. The return type is a list, with one element per search pattern. A simple case is shown below where the search pattern is the phrase “banana”. str_match(string = c(&quot;banana&quot;, &quot;bananageddon&quot;, &quot;bananas are bad&quot;), pattern = &quot;banana&quot;) #&gt; [,1] #&gt; [1,] &quot;banana&quot; #&gt; [2,] &quot;banana&quot; #&gt; [3,] &quot;banana&quot; The search pattern can be extended to look for multiple subsets of the search pattern. Consider searching for dates and times. Here, the search pattern is a regex pattern that looks for a set of four digits (\\\\d{4}) and a month name (\\\\w+) seperated by a hyphen. There’s much more to be explored in dealing with dates and times in lubridate, another tidyverse package. The return type is a list, each element is a character matrix where the first column is the string subset matching the full search pattern, and then as many columns as there are parts to the search pattern. The parts of interest in the search pattern are indicated by wrapping them in parentheses. For example, in the case below, wrapping [-.] in parentheses will turn it into a distinct part of the search pattern. # first with [-.] treated simply as a separator str_match(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01&quot;, &quot;1990-anothermonth-01&quot;, &quot;2010-thismonth-01&quot;), pattern = &quot;(\\\\d{4})[-.](\\\\w+)&quot;) #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #&gt; [1,] &quot;1970-somemonth&quot; &quot;1970&quot; &quot;somemonth&quot; #&gt; [2,] &quot;1990-anothermonth&quot; &quot;1990&quot; &quot;anothermonth&quot; #&gt; [3,] &quot;2010-thismonth&quot; &quot;2010&quot; &quot;thismonth&quot; # then with [-.] actively searched for str_match(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01&quot;, &quot;1990-anothermonth-01&quot;, &quot;2010-thismonth-01&quot;), pattern = &quot;(\\\\d{4})([-.])(\\\\w+)&quot;) #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] #&gt; [1,] &quot;1970-somemonth&quot; &quot;1970&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;somemonth&quot; #&gt; [2,] &quot;1990-anothermonth&quot; &quot;1990&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;anothermonth&quot; #&gt; [3,] &quot;2010-thismonth&quot; &quot;2010&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;thismonth&quot; Multiple possible matches are dealt with using str_match_all. An example case is uncertainty in date-time in raw data, where the date has been entered as 1970-somemonth-01 or 1970/anothermonth/01. The return type is a list, with one element per input string. Each element is a character matrix, where each row is one possible match, and each column after the first (the full match) corresponds to the parts of the search pattern. # first with a single date entry str_match_all(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01&quot;), pattern = &quot;(\\\\d{4})[\\\\-\\\\/]([a-z]+)&quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #&gt; [1,] &quot;1970-somemonth&quot; &quot;1970&quot; &quot;somemonth&quot; #&gt; [2,] &quot;1990/anothermonth&quot; &quot;1990&quot; &quot;anothermonth&quot; # then with multiple date entries str_match_all(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01&quot;, &quot;1990-somemonth-01 or maybe 2001/anothermonth/01&quot;), pattern = &quot;(\\\\d{4})[\\\\-\\\\/]([a-z]+)&quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #&gt; [1,] &quot;1970-somemonth&quot; &quot;1970&quot; &quot;somemonth&quot; #&gt; [2,] &quot;1990/anothermonth&quot; &quot;1990&quot; &quot;anothermonth&quot; #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; [,1] [,2] [,3] #&gt; [1,] &quot;1990-somemonth&quot; &quot;1990&quot; &quot;somemonth&quot; #&gt; [2,] &quot;2001/anothermonth&quot; &quot;2001&quot; &quot;anothermonth&quot; 1.2.4 Simpler pattern extraction The full functionality of str_match_* can be boiled down to the most common use case, extracting one or more full matches of the search pattern using str_extract and str_extract_all respectively. str_extract returns a character vector with the same length as the input string vector, while str_extract_all returns a list, with a character vector whose elements are the matches. # extracting the first full match using str_extract str_extract(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01&quot;, &quot;1990-somemonth-01 or maybe 2001/anothermonth/01&quot;), pattern = &quot;(\\\\d{4})[\\\\-\\\\/]([a-z]+)&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;1970-somemonth&quot; &quot;1990-somemonth&quot; # extracting all full matches using str_extract all str_extract_all(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01 or maybe 1990/anothermonth/01&quot;, &quot;1990-somemonth-01 or maybe 2001/anothermonth/01&quot;), pattern = &quot;(\\\\d{4})[\\\\-\\\\/]([a-z]+)&quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] &quot;1970-somemonth&quot; &quot;1990/anothermonth&quot; #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; [1] &quot;1990-somemonth&quot; &quot;2001/anothermonth&quot; 1.2.5 Breaking strings apart str_split, str_sub, In the above date-time example, when reading filenames from a path, or when working sequences separated by a known pattern generally, str_split can help separate elements of interest. The return type is a list similar to str_match. # split on either a hyphen or a forward slash str_split(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01&quot;, &quot;1990/anothermonth/01&quot;), pattern = &quot;[\\\\-\\\\/]&quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] &quot;1970&quot; &quot;somemonth&quot; &quot;01&quot; #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; [1] &quot;1990&quot; &quot;anothermonth&quot; &quot;01&quot; This can be useful in recovering simulation parameters from a filename, but may require some knowledge of regex. # assume a simulation output file filename = &quot;sim_param1_0.01_param2_0.05_param3_0.01.ext&quot; # not quite there str_split(filename, pattern = &quot;_&quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] &quot;sim&quot; &quot;param1&quot; &quot;0.01&quot; &quot;param2&quot; &quot;0.05&quot; &quot;param3&quot; &quot;0.01.ext&quot; # not really str_split(filename, pattern = &quot;sim_&quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] &quot;&quot; #&gt; [2] &quot;param1_0.01_param2_0.05_param3_0.01.ext&quot; # getting there but still needs work str_split(filename, pattern = &quot;(sim_)|_*param\\\\d{1}_|(.ext)&quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;0.01&quot; &quot;0.05&quot; &quot;0.01&quot; &quot;&quot; str_split_fixed split the string into as many pieces as specified, and can be especially useful dealing with filepaths. # split on either a hyphen or a forward slash str_split_fixed(string = &quot;dir_level_1/dir_level_2/file.ext&quot;, pattern = &quot;/&quot;, n = 2) #&gt; [,1] [,2] #&gt; [1,] &quot;dir_level_1&quot; &quot;dir_level_2/file.ext&quot; 1.2.6 Replacing string elements str_replace is intended to replace the search pattern, and can be co-opted into the task of recovering simulation parameters or other data from regularly named files. str_replace_all works the same way but replaces all matches of the search pattern. # replace all unwanted characters from this hypothetical filename with spaces filename = &quot;sim_param1_0.01_param2_0.05_param3_0.01.ext&quot; str_replace_all(filename, pattern = &quot;(sim_)|_*param\\\\d{1}_|(.ext)&quot;, replacement = &quot; &quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot; 0.01 0.05 0.01 &quot; str_remove is a wrapper around str_replace where the replacement is set to \"\". This is not covered here. Having replaced unwanted characters in the filename with spaces, str_trim offers a way to remove leading and trailing whitespaces. # trim whitespaces from this filename after replacing unwanted text filename = &quot;sim_param1_0.01_param2_0.05_param3_0.01.ext&quot; filename_with_spaces = str_replace_all(filename, pattern = &quot;(sim_)|_*param\\\\d{1}_|(.ext)&quot;, replacement = &quot; &quot;) filename_without_spaces = str_trim(filename_with_spaces) filename_without_spaces #&gt; [1] &quot;0.01 0.05 0.01&quot; # the result can be split on whitespaces to return useful data str_split(filename_without_spaces, &quot; &quot;) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] &quot;0.01&quot; &quot;0.05&quot; &quot;0.01&quot; 1.2.7 Subsetting within strings When strings are highly regular, useful data can be extracted from a string using str_sub. In the date-time example, the year is always represented by the first four characters. # get the year as characters 1 - 4 str_sub(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01&quot;, &quot;1990-anothermonth-01&quot;, &quot;2010-thismonth-01&quot;), start = 1, end = 4) #&gt; [1] &quot;1970&quot; &quot;1990&quot; &quot;2010&quot; Similarly, it’s possible to extract the last few characters using negative indices. # get the day as characters -2 to -1 str_sub(string = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-01&quot;, &quot;1990-anothermonth-21&quot;, &quot;2010-thismonth-31&quot;), start = -2, end = -1) #&gt; [1] &quot;01&quot; &quot;21&quot; &quot;31&quot; Finally, it’s also possible to replace characters within a string based on the position. This requires using the assignment operator &lt;-. # replace all days in these dates to 01 date_times = c(&quot;1970-somemonth-25&quot;, &quot;1990-anothermonth-21&quot;, &quot;2010-thismonth-31&quot;) # a strictly necessary use of the assignment operator str_sub(date_times, start = -2, end = -1) &lt;- &quot;01&quot; date_times #&gt; [1] &quot;1970-somemonth-01&quot; &quot;1990-anothermonth-01&quot; &quot;2010-thismonth-01&quot; 1.2.8 Padding and truncating strings Strings included in filenames or plots are often of unequal lengths, especially when they represent numbers. str_pad can pad strings with suitable characters to maintain equal length filenames, with which it is easier to work. # pad so all values have three digits str_pad(string = c(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;100&quot;), width = 3, side = &quot;left&quot;, pad = &quot;0&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;001&quot; &quot;010&quot; &quot;100&quot; Strings can also be truncated if they are too long. str_trunc(string = c(&quot;bananas are great and wonderful and more stuff about bananas and it really goes on about bananas&quot;), width = 27, side = &quot;right&quot;, ellipsis = &quot;etc. etc.&quot;) #&gt; [1] &quot;bananas are great etc. etc.&quot; 1.2.9 Stringr aspects not covered here Some stringr functions are not covered here. These include: str_wrap (of dubious use), str_interp, str_glue* (better to use glue; see below), str_sort, str_order (used in sorting a character vector), str_to_case* (case conversion), and str_view* (a graphical view of search pattern matches). word, boundary etc. The use of word is covered below. stringi, of which stringr is a wrapper, offers a lot more flexibility and control. 1.3 String interpolation with glue The idea behind string interpolation is to procedurally generate new complex strings from pre-existing data. glue is as simple as the example shown. # print that each car name is a car model cars = rownames(head(mtcars)) glue(&#39;The {cars} is a car model&#39;) #&gt; The Mazda RX4 is a car model #&gt; The Mazda RX4 Wag is a car model #&gt; The Datsun 710 is a car model #&gt; The Hornet 4 Drive is a car model #&gt; The Hornet Sportabout is a car model #&gt; The Valiant is a car model This creates and prints a vector of car names stating each is a car model. The related glue_data is even more useful in printing from a dataframe. In this example, it can quickly generate command line arguments or filenames. # use dataframes for now parameter_combinations = data.frame(param1 = letters[1:5], param2 = 1:5) # for command line arguments or to start multiple job scripts on the cluster glue_data(parameter_combinations, &#39;simulation-name {param1} {param2}&#39;) #&gt; simulation-name a 1 #&gt; simulation-name b 2 #&gt; simulation-name c 3 #&gt; simulation-name d 4 #&gt; simulation-name e 5 # for filenames glue_data(parameter_combinations, &#39;sim_data_param1_{param1}_param2_{param2}.ext&#39;) #&gt; sim_data_param1_a_param2_1.ext #&gt; sim_data_param1_b_param2_2.ext #&gt; sim_data_param1_c_param2_3.ext #&gt; sim_data_param1_d_param2_4.ext #&gt; sim_data_param1_e_param2_5.ext Finally, the convenient glue_sql and glue_data_sql are used to safely write SQL queries where variables from data are appropriately quoted. This is not covered here, but it is good to know it exists. glue has some more functions — glue_safe, glue_collapse, and glue_col, but these are infrequently used. Their functionality can be found on the glue github page. 1.4 Strings in ggplot ggplot has two geoms (wait for the ggplot tutorial to understand more about geoms) that work with text: geom_text and geom_label. These geoms allow text to be pasted on to the main body of a plot. Often, these may overlap when the data are closely spaced. The package ggrepel offers another geom, geom_text_repel (and the related geom_label_repel) that help arrange text on a plot so it doesn’t overlap with other features. This is not perfect, but it works more often than not. More examples can be found on the ggrepl website. Here, the arguments to geom_text_repel are taken both from the mtcars data (position), as well as from the car brands extracted using the stringr::word (labels), which tries to separate strings based on a regular pattern. The details of ggplot are covered in a later tutorial. library(ggplot2) library(ggrepel) # prepare car labels using word function car_labels = word(rownames(mtcars)) ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, label = rownames(mtcars)))+ geom_point(colour = &quot;red&quot;)+ geom_text_repel(aes(label = car_labels), direction = &quot;x&quot;, nudge_x = 0.2, box.padding = 0.5, point.padding = 0.5) This is not a good looking plot, because it breaks other rules of plot design, such as whether this sort of plot should be made at all. Labels and text need to be applied sparingly, for example drawing attention or adding information to outliers. "],

But first, let us take a detour and introduce the tibble. 2.1 The new data frame: tibble The tibble is the recommended class to use to store tabular data in the tidyverse. Consider it as the operational unit of any data science pipeline. For most practical purposes, a tibble is basically a data.frame. # Make a data frame data.frame(who = c(&quot;Pratik&quot;, &quot;Theo&quot;, &quot;Raph&quot;), chapt = c(&quot;1, 4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2, 5&quot;)) #&gt; who chapt #&gt; 1 Pratik 1, 4 #&gt; 2 Theo 3 #&gt; 3 Raph 2, 5 # Or an equivalent tibble tibble(who = c(&quot;Pratik&quot;, &quot;Theo&quot;, &quot;Raph&quot;), chapt = c(&quot;1, 4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2, 5&quot;)) #&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2 #&gt; who chapt #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Pratik 1, 4 #&gt; 2 Theo 3 #&gt; 3 Raph 2, 5 The difference between tibble and data.frame is in its display and in the way it is subsetted, among others. Most functions working with data.frame will work with tibble and vice versa. Use the as* family of functions to switch back and forth between the two if needed, using e.g. as.data.frame or as_tibble. In terms of display, the tibble has the advantage of showing the class of each column: chr for character, fct for factor, int for integer, dbl for numeric and lgl for logical, just to name the main atomic classes. This may be more important than you think, because many hard-to-find bugs in R are due to wrong variable types and/or cryptic type conversions. This especially happens with factor and character, which can cause quite some confusion. More about this in the extra section at the end of this chapter! Note that you can build a tibble by rows rather than by columns with tribble: tribble( ~who, ~chapt, &quot;Pratik&quot;, &quot;1, 4&quot;, &quot;Theo&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;Raph&quot;, &quot;2, 5&quot; ) #&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2 #&gt; who chapt #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Pratik 1, 4 #&gt; 2 Theo 3 #&gt; 3 Raph 2, 5 As a rule of thumb, try to convert your tables to tibbles whenever you can, especially when the original table is not a data frame. For example, the principal component analysis function prcomp outputs a matrix of coordinates in principal component-space. # Perform a PCA on mtcars pca_scores &lt;- prcomp(mtcars)$x head(pca_scores) # looks like a data frame or a tibble... #&gt; PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 #&gt; Mazda RX4 -79.60 2.13 -2.15 -2.707 -0.702 -0.3149 -0.09870 -0.0779 #&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag -79.60 2.15 -2.22 -2.178 -0.884 -0.4534 -0.00355 -0.0957 #&gt; Datsun 710 -133.89 -5.06 -2.14 0.346 1.106 1.1730 0.00576 0.1362 #&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 8.52 44.99 1.23 0.827 0.424 -0.0579 -0.02431 0.2212 #&gt; Hornet Sportabout 128.69 30.82 3.34 -0.521 0.737 -0.3329 0.10630 -0.0530 #&gt; Valiant -23.22 35.11 -3.26 1.401 0.803 -0.0884 0.23895 0.4239 #&gt; PC9 PC10 PC11 #&gt; Mazda RX4 -0.200 -0.2901 0.106 #&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag -0.353 -0.1928 0.107 #&gt; Datsun 710 -0.198 0.0763 0.267 #&gt; Hornet 4 Drive 0.356 -0.0906 0.209 #&gt; Hornet Sportabout 0.153 -0.1886 -0.109 #&gt; Valiant 0.101 -0.0377 0.276 class(pca_scores) # but is actually a matrix #&gt; [1] &quot;matrix&quot; # Convert to tibble as_tibble(pca_scores) #&gt; # A tibble: 32 x 11 #&gt; PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 PC9 PC10 #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 -79.6 2.13 -2.15 -2.71 -0.702 -0.315 -0.0987 -0.0779 -0.200 -0.290 #&gt; 2 -79.6 2.15 -2.22 -2.18 -0.884 -0.453 -0.00355 -0.0957 -0.353 -0.193 #&gt; 3 -134. -5.06 -2.14 0.346 1.11 1.17 0.00576 0.136 -0.198 0.0763 #&gt; 4 8.52 45.0 1.23 0.827 0.424 -0.0579 -0.0243 0.221 0.356 -0.0906 #&gt; 5 129. 30.8 3.34 -0.521 0.737 -0.333 0.106 -0.0530 0.153 -0.189 #&gt; 6 -23.2 35.1 -3.26 1.40 0.803 -0.0884 0.239 0.424 0.101 -0.0377 #&gt; # … with 26 more rows, and 1 more variable: PC11 &lt;dbl&gt; This is important because a matrix can contain only one type of values (e.g. only numeric or character), while tibble (and data.frame) allow you to have columns of different types. So, in the tidyverse we are going to work with tibbles, got it. But what does “tidy” mean exactly? 2.2 The concept of tidy data When it comes to putting data into tables, there are many ways one could organize a dataset. The tidy format is one such format. According to the formal definition, a table is tidy if each column is a variable and each row is an observation. In practice, however, I found that this is not a very operational definition, especially in ecology and evolution where we often record multiple variables per individual. So, let’s dig in with an example. Say we have a dataset of several morphometrics measured on Darwin’s finches in the Galapagos islands. Let’s first get this dataset. # We first simulate random data beak_lengths &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 0.1) beak_widths &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 2, sd = 0.1) body_weights &lt;- rgamma(100, shape = 10, rate = 1) islands &lt;- rep(c(&quot;Isabela&quot;, &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;), each = 50) # Assemble into a tibble data &lt;- tibble( id = 1:100, body_weight = body_weights, beak_length = beak_lengths, beak_width = beak_widths, island = islands ) # Snapshot data #&gt; # A tibble: 100 x 5 #&gt; id body_weight beak_length beak_width island #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 1 10.8 4.94 1.94 Isabela #&gt; 2 2 15.4 5.02 2.00 Isabela #&gt; 3 3 15.0 4.92 1.91 Isabela #&gt; 4 4 8.51 5.16 2.02 Isabela #&gt; 5 5 14.9 5.03 1.93 Isabela #&gt; 6 6 8.41 4.92 2.18 Isabela #&gt; # … with 94 more rows Here, we pretend to have measured beak_length, beak_width and body_weight on 100 birds, 50 of them from Isabela and 50 of them from Santa Cruz. In this tibble, each row is an individual bird. This is probably the way most scientists would record their data in the field. However, a single bird is not an “observation” in the sense used in the tidyverse. Our dataset is not tidy but messy. The tidy equivalent of this dataset would be: data &lt;- pivot_longer( data, cols = c(&quot;body_weight&quot;, &quot;beak_length&quot;, &quot;beak_width&quot;), names_to = &quot;variable&quot; ) data #&gt; # A tibble: 300 x 4 #&gt; id island variable value #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length 4.94 #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width 1.94 #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight 15.4 #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width 2.00 #&gt; # … with 294 more rows where each measurement (and not each individual) is now the unit of observation (the rows). The pivot_longer function is the easiest way to get to this format. It belongs to the tidyr package, which we’ll cover in a minute. As you can see our tibble now has three times as many rows and fewer columns. This format is rather unintuitive and not optimal for display. However, it provides a very standardized and consistent way of organizing data that will be understood (and expected) by pretty much all functions in the tidyverse. This makes the tidyverse tools work well together and reduces the time you would otherwise spend reformatting your data from one tool to the next. That does not mean that the messy format is useless though. There may be use-cases where you need to switch back and forth between formats. For this reason I prefer referring to these formats using their other names: long (tidy) versus wide (messy). For example, matrix operations work much faster on wide data, and the wide format arguably looks nicer for display. Luckily the tidyr package gives us the tools to reshape our data as needed, as we shall see shortly. Another common example of wide-or-long dilemma is when dealing with contingency tables. This would be our case, for example, if we asked how many observations we have for each morphometric and each island. We use table (from base R) to get the answer: # Make a contingency table ctg &lt;- with(data, table(island, variable)) ctg #&gt; variable #&gt; island beak_length beak_width body_weight #&gt; Isabela 50 50 50 #&gt; Santa Cruz 50 50 50 A variety of statistical tests can be used on contingency tables such as Fisher’s exact test, the chi-square test or the binomial test. Contingency tables are in the wide format by construction, but they too can be pivoted to the long format, and the tidyverse manipulation tools will expect you to do so. Actually, tibble knows that very well and does it by default if you convert your table into a tibble: # Contingency table is pivoted to the long-format automatically as_tibble(ctg) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; island variable n #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 Isabela beak_length 50 #&gt; 2 Santa Cruz beak_length 50 #&gt; 3 Isabela beak_width 50 #&gt; 4 Santa Cruz beak_width 50 #&gt; 5 Isabela body_weight 50 #&gt; 6 Santa Cruz body_weight 50 Summary: Tidy or not tidy To sum up, the definition of what is tidy and what is not is somewhat subjective. Tables can be in long or wide format, and depending on the complexity of a dataset, there may even be some intermediate states. To be clear, the tidyverse does not only accept long tables, and wide tables may sometimes be the way to go. This is very use-case specific. Have a clear idea of what you want to do with your data (what tidyverse tools you will use), and use that to figure which format makes more sense. And remember, tidyr is here to easily do the switching for you. 2.3 Reshaping with tidyr The tidyr package implements tools to easily switch between layouts and also perform a few other reshaping operations. Old school R users will be familiar with the reshape and reshape2 packages, of which tidyr is the tidyverse equivalent. Beware that tidyr is about playing with the general layout of the dataset, while operations and transformations of the data are within the scope of the dplyr and purrr packages. All these packages work hand-in-hand really well, and analysis pipelines usually involve all of them. But today, we focus on the first member of this holy trinity, which is often the first one you’ll need because you will want to reshape your data before doing other things. So, please hold your non-layout-related questions for the next chapters. 2.3.1 Pivoting Pivoting a dataset between the long and wide layout is the main purpose of tidyr (check out the package’s logo). We already saw the pivot_longer function above. This function converts a table form wide to long format. Similarly, there is a pivot_wider function that does exactly the opposite and takes you back to the wide format: pivot_wider( data, names_from = &quot;variable&quot;, values_from = &quot;value&quot;, id_cols = c(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;island&quot;) ) #&gt; # A tibble: 100 x 5 #&gt; id island body_weight beak_length beak_width #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela 10.8 4.94 1.94 #&gt; 2 2 Isabela 15.4 5.02 2.00 #&gt; 3 3 Isabela 15.0 4.92 1.91 #&gt; 4 4 Isabela 8.51 5.16 2.02 #&gt; 5 5 Isabela 14.9 5.03 1.93 #&gt; 6 6 Isabela 8.41 4.92 2.18 #&gt; # … with 94 more rows The order of the columns is not exactly as it was, but this should not matter in a data analysis pipeline where you should access columns by their names. It is straightforward to change the order of the columns, but this is more within the scope of the dplyr package. If you are familiar with earlier versions of the tidyverse, pivot_longer and pivot_wider are the respective equivalents of gather and spread, which are now deprecated. There are a few other reshaping operations from tidyr that are worth knowing. 2.3.2 Handling missing values Say we have some missing measurements in the column “value” of our finch dataset: # We replace 100 random observations by NAs ii &lt;- sample(nrow(data), 100) data$value[ii] &lt;- NA data #&gt; # A tibble: 300 x 4 #&gt; id island variable value #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length NA #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width NA #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight NA #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width NA #&gt; # … with 294 more rows We could get rid of the rows that have missing values using drop_na: drop_na(data, value) #&gt; # A tibble: 200 x 4 #&gt; id island variable value #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 #&gt; 2 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 #&gt; 3 3 Isabela body_weight 15.0 #&gt; 4 3 Isabela beak_length 4.92 #&gt; 5 4 Isabela body_weight 8.51 #&gt; 6 4 Isabela beak_width 2.02 #&gt; # … with 194 more rows Else, we could replace the NAs with some user-defined value: replace_na(data, replace = list(value = -999)) #&gt; # A tibble: 300 x 4 #&gt; id island variable value #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length -999 #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width -999 #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight -999 #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width -999 #&gt; # … with 294 more rows where the replace argument takes a named list, and the names should refer to the columns to apply the replacement to. We could also replace NAs with the most recent non-NA values: fill(data, value) #&gt; # A tibble: 300 x 4 #&gt; id island variable value #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length 10.8 #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width 10.8 #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight 10.8 #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width 5.02 #&gt; # … with 294 more rows Note that most functions in the tidyverse take a tibble as their first argument, and columns to which to apply the functions are usually passed as “objects” rather than character strings. In the above example, we passed the value column as value, not \"value\". These column-objects are called by the tidyverse functions in the context of the data (the tibble) they belong to. 2.3.3 Splitting and combining cells The tidyr package offers tools to split and combine columns. This is a nice extension to the string manipulations we saw last week in the stringr tutorial. Say we want to add the specific dates when we took measurements on our birds (we would normally do this using dplyr but for now we will stick to the old way): # Sample random dates for each observation data$day &lt;- sample(30, nrow(data), replace = TRUE) data$month &lt;- sample(12, nrow(data), replace = TRUE) data$year &lt;- sample(2019:2020, nrow(data), replace = TRUE) data #&gt; # A tibble: 300 x 7 #&gt; id island variable value day month year #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 8 7 2020 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length NA 19 7 2019 #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width NA 17 12 2019 #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight NA 20 12 2020 #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 21 10 2020 #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width NA 23 2 2020 #&gt; # … with 294 more rows We could combine the day, month and year columns into a single date column, with a dash as a separator, using unite: data &lt;- unite(data, day, month, year, col = &quot;date&quot;, sep = &quot;-&quot;) data #&gt; # A tibble: 300 x 5 #&gt; id island variable value date #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 8-7-2020 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length NA 19-7-2019 #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width NA 17-12-2019 #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight NA 20-12-2020 #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 21-10-2020 #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width NA 23-2-2020 #&gt; # … with 294 more rows Of course, we can revert back to the previous dataset by splitting the date column with separate. separate(data, date, into = c(&quot;day&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) #&gt; # A tibble: 300 x 7 #&gt; id island variable value day month year #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 8 7 2020 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length NA 19 7 2019 #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width NA 17 12 2019 #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight NA 20 12 2020 #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 21 10 2020 #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width NA 23 2 2020 #&gt; # … with 294 more rows But note that the day, month and year columns are now of class character and not integer anymore. This is because they result from the splitting of date, which itself was a character column. You can also separate a single column into multiple rows using separate_rows: separate_rows(data, date) #&gt; # A tibble: 900 x 5 #&gt; id island variable value date #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 8 #&gt; 2 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 7 #&gt; 3 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 2020 #&gt; 4 1 Isabela beak_length NA 19 #&gt; 5 1 Isabela beak_length NA 7 #&gt; 6 1 Isabela beak_length NA 2019 #&gt; # … with 894 more rows 2.3.4 Expanding tables using combinations Instead of getting rid of rows with NAs, we may want to add rows with NAs, for example, for combinations of parameters that we did not measure. data &lt;- separate(data, date, into = c(&quot;day&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;year&quot;)) to_rm &lt;- with(data, island == &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; &amp; year == &quot;2020&quot;) data &lt;- data[!to_rm,] tail(data) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 7 #&gt; id island variable value day month year #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 98 Santa Cruz beak_length 4.94 22 12 2019 #&gt; 2 98 Santa Cruz beak_width 1.90 9 1 2019 #&gt; 3 99 Santa Cruz body_weight 15.0 16 7 2019 #&gt; 4 99 Santa Cruz beak_length NA 26 10 2019 #&gt; 5 99 Santa Cruz beak_width 2.04 30 7 2019 #&gt; 6 100 Santa Cruz beak_width NA 23 3 2019 We could generate a tibble with all combinations of island, morphometric and year using expand_grid: expand_grid( island = c(&quot;Isabela&quot;, &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;), year = c(&quot;2019&quot;, &quot;2020&quot;) ) #&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 2 #&gt; island year #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Isabela 2019 #&gt; 2 Isabela 2020 #&gt; 3 Santa Cruz 2019 #&gt; 4 Santa Cruz 2020 If we already have a tibble to work from that contains the variables to combine, we can use expand on that tibble: expand(data, island, year) #&gt; # A tibble: 4 x 2 #&gt; island year #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Isabela 2019 #&gt; 2 Isabela 2020 #&gt; 3 Santa Cruz 2019 #&gt; 4 Santa Cruz 2020 As you can see, we get all the combinations of the variables of interest, even those that are missing. But sometimes you might be interested in variables that are nested within each other and not crossed. For example, say we have measured birds at different locations within each island: nrow_Isabela &lt;- with(data, length(which(island == &quot;Isabela&quot;))) nrow_SantaCruz &lt;- with(data, length(which(island == &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;))) sites_Isabela &lt;- sample(c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), size = nrow_Isabela, replace = TRUE) sites_SantaCruz &lt;- sample(c(&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;), size = nrow_SantaCruz, replace = TRUE) sites &lt;- c(sites_Isabela, sites_SantaCruz) data$site &lt;- sites data #&gt; # A tibble: 232 x 8 #&gt; id island variable value day month year site #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Isabela body_weight 10.8 8 7 2020 A #&gt; 2 1 Isabela beak_length NA 19 7 2019 B #&gt; 3 1 Isabela beak_width NA 17 12 2019 B #&gt; 4 2 Isabela body_weight NA 20 12 2020 A #&gt; 5 2 Isabela beak_length 5.02 21 10 2020 A #&gt; 6 2 Isabela beak_width NA 23 2 2020 A #&gt; # … with 226 more rows Of course, if sites A and B are on Isabela, they cannot be on Santa Cruz, where we have sites C and D instead. It would not make sense to expand assuming that island and site are crossed, instead, they are nested. We can therefore expand using the nesting function: expand(data, nesting(island, site, year)) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; island site year #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Isabela A 2019 #&gt; 2 Isabela A 2020 #&gt; 3 Isabela B 2019 #&gt; 4 Isabela B 2020 #&gt; 5 Santa Cruz C 2019 #&gt; 6 Santa Cruz D 2019 But now the missing data for Santa Cruz in 2020 are not accounted for because expand thinks the year is also nested within island. To get back the missing combination, we use crossing, the complement of nesting: expand(data, crossing(nesting(island, site), year)) # both can be used together #&gt; # A tibble: 8 x 3 #&gt; island site year #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Isabela A 2019 #&gt; 2 Isabela A 2020 #&gt; 3 Isabela B 2019 #&gt; 4 Isabela B 2020 #&gt; 5 Santa Cruz C 2019 #&gt; 6 Santa Cruz C 2020 #&gt; # … with 2 more rows Here, we specify that site is nested within island and these two are crossed with year. Easy! But wait a minute. These combinations are all very good, but our measurements have disappeared! We can get them back by levelling up to the complete function instead of using expand: tail(complete(data, crossing(nesting(island, site), year))) #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 8 #&gt; island site year id variable value day month #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Santa Cruz D 2019 95 beak_width NA 13 10 #&gt; 2 Santa Cruz D 2019 98 beak_length 4.94 22 12 #&gt; 3 Santa Cruz D 2019 99 body_weight 15.0 16 7 #&gt; 4 Santa Cruz D 2019 99 beak_length NA 26 10 #&gt; 5 Santa Cruz D 2019 99 beak_width 2.04 30 7 #&gt; 6 Santa Cruz D 2020 NA &lt;NA&gt; NA &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; # the last row has been added, full of NAs which nicely keeps the rest of the columns in the tibble and just adds the missing combinations. 2.3.5 Nesting The tidyr package has yet another feature that makes the tidyverse very powerful: the nest function. However, it makes little sense without combining it with the functions in the purrr package, so we will not cover it in this chapter but rather in the purrr chapter. 2.3.6 What else can be tidied up? 2.3.6.1 Model output with broom Check out the broom package and its tidy function to tidy up messy linear model output, e.g. library(broom) fit &lt;- lm(mpg ~ cyl, mtcars) summary(fit) #&gt; #&gt; Call: #&gt; lm(formula = mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars) #&gt; #&gt; Residuals: #&gt; Min 1Q Median 3Q Max #&gt; -4.981 -2.119 0.222 1.072 7.519 #&gt; #&gt; Coefficients: #&gt; Estimate Std.

This is the case, for example, for data underlying graphs (as in networks), which contain information about relations between entities. What is the unit of observation in a network? A node? An edge between two nodes? Nodes and edges in a network may each have node- or edge-specific variables mapped to them, and both may be equally valid units of observation. The tidygraph package has tools to store graph-data in a tidyverse-friendly object, consisting of two tibbles: one for node-specific information, the other for edge-specific information. This package goes hand in hand with the ggraph, that makes plotting networks compatible with the grammar of graphics. 2.3.6.3 Trees with tidytree Phylogenetic trees are a special type of graphs suffering from the same issue, i.e. of being non-trivial to store in a table. The tidytree package and its companion treeio offer an interface to convert tree-like objects (from most format used by other packages and software) into a tidyverse-friendly format. Again, the point is that the rest of the tidyverse can be used to wrangle or plot this type of data in the same way as one would do with regular tabular data. For plotting a tidytree with the grammar of graphics, see ggtree. 2.4 Extra: factors and the forcats package library(forcats) Categorical variables can be stored in R as character strings in character or factor objects. A factor looks like a character, but it actually is an integer vector, where each integer is mapped to a character label. With this respect it is sort of an enhanced version of character. For example, my_char_vec &lt;- c(&quot;Pratik&quot;, &quot;Theo&quot;, &quot;Raph&quot;) my_char_vec #&gt; [1] &quot;Pratik&quot; &quot;Theo&quot; &quot;Raph&quot; is a character vector, recognizable to its double quotes, while my_fact_vec &lt;- factor(my_char_vec) # as.factor would work too my_fact_vec #&gt; [1] Pratik Theo Raph #&gt; Levels: Pratik Raph Theo is a factor, of which the labels are displayed. The levels of the factor are the unique values that appear in the vector. If I added an extra occurrence of my name: factor(c(my_char_vec, &quot;Raph&quot;)) #&gt; [1] Pratik Theo Raph Raph #&gt; Levels: Pratik Raph Theo we would still have the the same levels. Note that the levels are returned as a character vector in alphabetical order by the levels function: levels(my_fact_vec) #&gt; [1] &quot;Pratik&quot; &quot;Raph&quot; &quot;Theo&quot; Why does it matter? Well, most operations on categorical variables can be performed on character of factor objects, so it does not matter so much which one you use for your own data. However, some functions in R require you to provide categorical variables in one specific format, and others may even implicitely convert your variables. In ggplot2 for example, character vectors are converted into factors by default. So, it is always good to remember the differences and what type your variables are. But this is a tidyverse tutorial, so I would like to introduce here the package forcats, which offers tools to manipulate factors. First of all, most tools from stringr will work on factors. The forcats functions expand the string manipulation toolbox with factor-specific utilities. Similar in philosophy to stringr where functions started with str_, in forcats most functions start with fct_. I see two main ways forcats can come handy in the kind of data most people deal with: playing with the order of the levels of a factor and playing with the levels themselves. We will show here a few examples, but the full breadth of factor manipulations can be found online or in the excellent forcats cheatsheet. 2.4.1 Change the order of the levels One example use-case where you would want to change the order of the levels of a factor is when plotting. Your categorical variable, for example, may not be plotted in the order you want. If we plot the distribution of each variable across islands, we get # Make the plotting code a function so we can re-use it without copying and pasting my_plot &lt;- function(data) { # We do not cover the ggplot functions in this chapter, this is just to # illustrate our use-case, wait until chapter 5! library(ggplot2) ggplot(data, aes(x = island, y = value, color = island)) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.1) + facet_grid(variable ~ year, scales = &quot;free&quot;) + theme_bw() + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;forestgreen&quot;, &quot;goldenrod&quot;)) } my_plot(data) # Remember that data are missing from Santa Cruz in 2020 Here, the islands (horizontal axis) and the variables (the facets) are displayed in alphabetical order. When making a figure you may want to customize these orders in such a way that your message is optimally conveyed by your figure, and this may involve playing with the order of levels. Use fct_relevel to manually change the order of the levels: data$island &lt;- as.factor(data$island) # turn this column into a factor data$island &lt;- fct_relevel(data$island, c(&quot;Santa Cruz&quot;, &quot;Isabela&quot;)) my_plot(data) # order of islands has changed! Beware that reordering a factor does not change the order of the items within the vector, only the order of the levels. So, it does not introduce any mistmatch between the island column and the other columns! It only matters when the levels are called, for example, in a ggplot. As you can see: data$island[1:10] #&gt; [1] Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela #&gt; [10] Isabela #&gt; Levels: Santa Cruz Isabela fct_relevel(data$island, c(&quot;Isabela&quot;, &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;))[1:10] # same thing, different levels #&gt; [1] Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela Isabela #&gt; [10] Isabela #&gt; Levels: Isabela Santa Cruz Alternatively, use fct_inorder to set the order of the levels to the order in which they appear: data$variable &lt;- as.factor(data$variable) levels(data$variable) #&gt; [1] &quot;beak_length&quot; &quot;beak_width&quot; &quot;body_weight&quot; levels(fct_inorder(data$variable)) #&gt; [1] &quot;body_weight&quot; &quot;beak_length&quot; &quot;beak_width&quot; or fct_rev to reverse the order of the levels: levels(fct_rev(data$island)) # back in the alphabetical order #&gt; [1] &quot;Isabela&quot; &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; Other variants exist to do more complex reordering, all present in the forcats cheatsheet, for example: * fct_infreq to re-order according to the frequency of each level (how many observation on each island?) * fct_shift to shift the order of all levels by a certain rank (in a circular way so that the last one becomes the first one or vice versa) * fct_shuffle if you want your levels in random order * fct_reorder, which reorders based on an associated variable (see fct_reorder2 for even more complex relationship between the factor and the associated variable) 2.4.2 Change the levels themselves Changing the levels of a factor will change the labels in the actual vector. It is similar to performing a string substitution in stringr. One can change the levels of a factor using fct_recode: fct_recode( my_fact_vec, &quot;Pratik Gupte&quot; = &quot;Pratik&quot;, &quot;Theo Pannetier&quot; = &quot;Theo&quot;, &quot;Raphael Scherrer&quot; = &quot;Raph&quot; ) #&gt; [1] Pratik Gupte Theo Pannetier Raphael Scherrer #&gt; Levels: Pratik Gupte Raphael Scherrer Theo Pannetier or collapse factor levels together using fct_collapse: fct_collapse(my_fact_vec, EU = c(&quot;Theo&quot;, &quot;Raph&quot;), NonEU = &quot;Pratik&quot;) #&gt; [1] NonEU EU EU #&gt; Levels: NonEU EU Again, we do not provide an exhaustive list of forcats functions here but the most usual ones, to give a glimpse of many things that one can do with factors. So, if you are dealing with factors, remember that forcats may have handy tools for you. Among others: * fct_anon to “anonymize”, i.e. replace the levels by random integers * fct_lump to collapse levels together based on their frequency (e.g. the two most frequent levels together) 2.4.3 Dropping levels If you use factors in your tibble and get rid of one level, for any reason, the factor will usually remember the old levels, which may cause some problems when applying functions to your data. data &lt;- data[data$island == &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;,] # keep only one island unique(data$island) # Isabela is gone from the labels #&gt; [1] Santa Cruz #&gt; Levels: Santa Cruz Isabela levels(data$island) # but not from the levels #&gt; [1] &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; &quot;Isabela&quot; Use droplevels (from base R) to make sure you get rid of levels that are not in your data anymore: data &lt;- droplevels(data) levels(data$island) #&gt; [1] &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; Fortunately, most functions within the tidyverse will not complain about missing levels, and will automatically get rid of those inexistant levels for you. But because factors are such common causes of bugs, keep this in mind! Note that this is equivalent to doing: data$island &lt;- fct_drop(data$island) 2.4.4 Other things Among other things you can use in forcats: * fct_count to get the frequency of each level * fct_c to combine factors together 2.4.5 Take home message for forcats Use this package to manipulate your factors. Do you need factors? Or are character vectors enough? That is your call, and may depend on the kind of analyses you want to do and what they require. We saw here that for plotting, having factors can allow you to do quite some tweaking of the display. If you encounter a situation where the order of encoding of your character vector starts to matter, then maybe converting into a factor would make your life easier. And if you do so, remember that lots of tools to perform all kinds of manipulation are available to you with both stringrand forcats. 2.5 External resources Find lots of additional info by looking up the following links: The readr/tibble/tidyr and forcats cheatsheets.

The structure of dplyr revolves around a set of functions, the so-called verbs, that share a common syntax and logic, and are meant to work with one another in chained operations. Chained operations are performed with the pipe operator (%&gt;%), that will be introduced in section 3.2.2. The basic syntax is verb(data, variable), where data is a data frame and variable is the name of one or more columns containing a set of values for each observation. There are 5 main verbs, which names already hint at what they do: rename(), select(), filter(), mutate(), and summarise(). I’m going to introduce each of them (and a couple more) through the following sections. 3.1.2 Example data Through this tutorial, we will be using mammal trait data from the Phylacine database. Let’s have a peek at what it contains. phylacine &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/phylacine_traits.csv&quot;) phylacine #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 24 #&gt; Binomial.1.2 Order.1.2 Family.1.2 Genus.1.2 Species.1.2 Terrestrial Marine #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys_l… Rodentia Muridae Abditomys latidens 1 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys… Rodentia Muridae Abeomelo… sevia 1 0 #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomy… Rodentia Cricetidae Abrawaya… ruschii 1 0 #&gt; 4 Abrocoma_be… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma bennettii 1 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocoma_bo… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma boliviensis 1 0 #&gt; 6 Abrocoma_bu… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma budini 1 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows, and 17 more variables: Freshwater &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Aerial &lt;dbl&gt;, Life.Habit.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Life.Habit.Source &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.g &lt;dbl&gt;, Mass.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Comparison &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.Comparison.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Island.Endemicity &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Added.IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Diet.Plant &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Vertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Invertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Source &lt;chr&gt; readr automatically loads the data in a tibble, as we have seen in chapter 1 and 2. Calling the tibble gives a nice preview of what it contains. We have data for 5,831 mammal species, and the variables contain information on taxonomy, (broad) habitat, mass, IUCN status, and diet. If you remember Section 1.2 on tidy data, you may see that this data isn’t exactly tidy. In fact, some columns are in wide (and messy) format, like the “habitat” (terrestrial, marine, etc.) and diet columns. dplyr actually does not require your data to be strictly tidy. If you feel that your data satisfies the definition “one observation per row, one variable per column”, that’s probably good enough. I use a tibble here, but dplyr works equally well on base data frames. In fact, dplyr is built for data.frame objects, and tibbles are data frames. Therefore, tibbles are mortal. 3.2 Working with existing variables 3.2.1 Renaming variables with rename() The variable names in the phylacine dataset are descriptive, but quite unpractical. Typing Binomial.1.2. is cumbersome and subject to typos (in fact, I just made one). binomial would be much simpler to use. Changing names is straightforward with rename(). rename(.data = phylacine, &quot;binomial&quot; = Binomial.1.2) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 24 #&gt; binomial Order.1.2 Family.1.2 Genus.1.2 Species.1.2 Terrestrial Marine #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditom… Rodentia Muridae Abditomys latidens 1 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomel… Rodentia Muridae Abeomelo… sevia 1 0 #&gt; 3 Abraway… Rodentia Cricetidae Abrawaya… ruschii 1 0 #&gt; 4 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma bennettii 1 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma boliviensis 1 0 #&gt; 6 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma budini 1 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows, and 17 more variables: Freshwater &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Aerial &lt;dbl&gt;, Life.Habit.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Life.Habit.Source &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.g &lt;dbl&gt;, Mass.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Comparison &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.Comparison.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Island.Endemicity &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Added.IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Diet.Plant &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Vertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Invertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Source &lt;chr&gt; The first argument is always .data, the data table you want to apply change to. Note how columns are referred to. Once the data table as been passed as an argument, there is no need to refer to it directly anymore, dplyr understands that you’re dealing with variables inside that data frame. So drop that data$var, data[, \"var\"], and forget the very existence of attach() / detach(). You can refer to variables names either with strings or directly as objects, whether you’re reading or creating them: rename( phylacine, # this works binomial = Binomial.1.2 ) rename( phylacine, # this works too! binomial = &quot;Binomial.1.2&quot; ) rename( phylacine, # guess what &quot;binomial&quot; = &quot;Binomial.1.2&quot; ) I have applied similar changes to all variables in the dataset. Here is what the new names look like: #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 24 #&gt; binomial order family genus species terrestrial marine freshwater aerial #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditom… Rode… Murid… Abdi… latide… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomel… Rode… Murid… Abeo… sevia 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 3 Abraway… Rode… Crice… Abra… ruschii 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 4 Abrocom… Rode… Abroc… Abro… bennet… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocom… Rode… Abroc… Abro… bolivi… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 6 Abrocom… Rode… Abroc… Abro… budini 1 0 0 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows, and 15 more variables: life_habit_method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # life_habit_source &lt;chr&gt;, mass_g &lt;dbl&gt;, mass_method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # mass_source &lt;chr&gt;, mass_comparison &lt;chr&gt;, mass_comparison_source &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # island_endemicity &lt;chr&gt;, iucn_status &lt;chr&gt;, added_iucn_status &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # diet_plant &lt;dbl&gt;, diet_vertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, diet_invertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # diet_method &lt;chr&gt;, diet_source &lt;chr&gt; 3.2.2 The pipe operator %&gt;% If you have already come across pieces of code using the tidyverse, chances are that you have seen this odd symbol. While the pipe is not strictly-speaking a part of the tidyverse (it comes from its own package, magrittr), it is imported along with each package and widely used in conjunction with its functions. What does it do? Consider the following example with rename(): phylacine2 &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;data/phylacine_traits.csv&quot;) # regular syntax rename(phylacine2, &quot;binomial&quot; = &quot;Binomial.1.2&quot;) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 24 #&gt; binomial Order.1.2 Family.1.2 Genus.1.2 Species.1.2 Terrestrial Marine #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditom… Rodentia Muridae Abditomys latidens 1 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomel… Rodentia Muridae Abeomelo… sevia 1 0 #&gt; 3 Abraway… Rodentia Cricetidae Abrawaya… ruschii 1 0 #&gt; 4 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma bennettii 1 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma boliviensis 1 0 #&gt; 6 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma budini 1 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows, and 17 more variables: Freshwater &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Aerial &lt;dbl&gt;, Life.Habit.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Life.Habit.Source &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.g &lt;dbl&gt;, Mass.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Comparison &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.Comparison.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Island.Endemicity &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Added.IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Diet.Plant &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Vertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Invertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Source &lt;chr&gt; # alternative syntax with the pipe operator phylacine2 %&gt;% rename(&quot;binomial&quot; = &quot;Binomial.1.2&quot;) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 24 #&gt; binomial Order.1.2 Family.1.2 Genus.1.2 Species.1.2 Terrestrial Marine #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditom… Rodentia Muridae Abditomys latidens 1 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomel… Rodentia Muridae Abeomelo… sevia 1 0 #&gt; 3 Abraway… Rodentia Cricetidae Abrawaya… ruschii 1 0 #&gt; 4 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma bennettii 1 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma boliviensis 1 0 #&gt; 6 Abrocom… Rodentia Abrocomid… Abrocoma budini 1 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows, and 17 more variables: Freshwater &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Aerial &lt;dbl&gt;, Life.Habit.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Life.Habit.Source &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.g &lt;dbl&gt;, Mass.Method &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Mass.Comparison &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Mass.Comparison.Source &lt;chr&gt;, Island.Endemicity &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Added.IUCN.Status.1.2 &lt;chr&gt;, Diet.Plant &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Vertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Invertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, Diet.Method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # Diet.Source &lt;chr&gt; Got it? The pipe takes the object on its left-side and silently feeds it to the first argument of the function on its right-side. It could be read as “take x, then do…”. The reason for using the pipe is because it makes code syntax closer to the syntax of a sentence, and therefore, easier and faster for your brain to process (and write!) the code. In particular, the pipe enables easy chains of operations, where you apply something to an object, then apply something else to the outcome, and so on… Through the later sections, you will see some examples of chained operations with dplyr functions, but for that I first need to introduce a couple more verbs. Using the pipe can be quite unsettling at first, because you are not used to think in this way. But if you push a bit for it, I promise it will make things a lot easier (and it’s quite addictive!). To avoid typing the tedious symbols, magrittr installs a shortcut for you in RStudio. Use Ctrl + Shift + M on Windows, and Cmd + Shift + M on MacOS. Finally I should emphasize that the use of the pipe isn’t limited to the tidyverse, but extends to almost all R functions. Remember that by default the piped value is always matched to the first argument of the following function 5 %&gt;% rep(3) #&gt; [1] 5 5 5 &quot;meow&quot; %&gt;% cat() #&gt; meow If you need to pass the left-hand side to an argument other than the first, you can use the dot place-holder .. &quot;meow&quot; %&gt;% cat(&quot;cats&quot;, &quot;go&quot;) #&gt; meow cats go Because of its syntax, most base R operators are not compatible with the pipe (but this is very rarely needed). If needed, magrittr introduces alternative functions for operators. Subsetting operators can be piped, with the dot place-holder. # 5 %&gt;% * 3 # no, won&#39;t work # 5 %&gt;% .* 3 # neither 5 %&gt;% magrittr::multiply_by(3) # yes #&gt; [1] 15 # subsetting list(&quot;monkey see&quot;, &quot;monkey_do&quot;) %&gt;% .[[2]] #&gt; [1] &quot;monkey_do&quot; phylacine %&gt;% .$binomial %&gt;% head() #&gt; [1] &quot;Abditomys_latidens&quot; &quot;Abeomelomys_sevia&quot; &quot;Abrawayaomys_ruschii&quot; #&gt; [4] &quot;Abrocoma_bennettii&quot; &quot;Abrocoma_boliviensis&quot; &quot;Abrocoma_budini&quot; Because subsetting in this way is particularly hideous, dplyr delivers a function to extract values from a single variable. In only works on tables, though. phylacine %&gt;% pull(binomial) %&gt;% head() #&gt; [1] &quot;Abditomys_latidens&quot; &quot;Abeomelomys_sevia&quot; &quot;Abrawayaomys_ruschii&quot; #&gt; [4] &quot;Abrocoma_bennettii&quot; &quot;Abrocoma_boliviensis&quot; &quot;Abrocoma_budini&quot; 3.2.3 Select variables with select() To extract a set of variables (i.e. columns), use the conveniently-named select(). The basic syntax is the same as rename(): pass your data as the first argument, then call the variables to select, quoted or not. # Single variable phylacine %&gt;% select(binomial) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 1 #&gt; binomial #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys_latidens #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys_sevia #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomys_ruschii #&gt; 4 Abrocoma_bennettii #&gt; 5 Abrocoma_boliviensis #&gt; 6 Abrocoma_budini #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows # A set of variables phylacine %&gt;% select(genus, &quot;species&quot;, mass_g) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 3 #&gt; genus species mass_g #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys latidens 269 #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys sevia 52 #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomys ruschii 63 #&gt; 4 Abrocoma bennettii 250 #&gt; 5 Abrocoma boliviensis 158 #&gt; 6 Abrocoma budini 361. #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows # A range of contiguous variables phylacine %&gt;% select(family:terrestrial) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 4 #&gt; family genus species terrestrial #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Muridae Abditomys latidens 1 #&gt; 2 Muridae Abeomelomys sevia 1 #&gt; 3 Cricetidae Abrawayaomys ruschii 1 #&gt; 4 Abrocomidae Abrocoma bennettii 1 #&gt; 5 Abrocomidae Abrocoma boliviensis 1 #&gt; 6 Abrocomidae Abrocoma budini 1 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows You can select by variable numbers.

The conditions are supplied much the same way as you would do for an if statement. Along with mutate() (next section), this is probably the function you are going to use the most. For example, I might want to extract mammals above a given mass: # megafauna phylacine %&gt;% filter(mass_g &gt; 1e5) %&gt;% # 100 kg select(binomial, mass_g) #&gt; # A tibble: 302 x 2 #&gt; binomial mass_g #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Ailuropoda_melanoleuca 108400 #&gt; 2 Alcelaphus_buselaphus 171002. #&gt; 3 Alces_alces 356998 #&gt; 4 Archaeoindris_fontoynonti 160000 #&gt; 5 Arctocephalus_forsteri 101250 #&gt; 6 Arctocephalus_pusillus 178500 #&gt; # … with 296 more rows # non-extinct megafauna phylacine %&gt;% filter(mass_g &gt; 1e5, iucn_status != &quot;EP&quot;) %&gt;% select(binomial, mass_g, iucn_status) #&gt; # A tibble: 178 x 3 #&gt; binomial mass_g iucn_status #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Ailuropoda_melanoleuca 108400 VU #&gt; 2 Alcelaphus_buselaphus 171002.

This is done easily through mutate(). For example, consider the diet data: diet &lt;- phylacine %&gt;% select( binomial, contains(&quot;diet&quot;) &amp; !contains(c(&quot;method&quot;, &quot;source&quot;)) ) diet #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 4 #&gt; binomial diet_plant diet_vertebrate diet_invertebrate #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys_latidens 100 0 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys_sevia 78 3 19 #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomys_ruschii 88 1 11 #&gt; 4 Abrocoma_bennettii 100 0 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocoma_boliviensis 100 0 0 #&gt; 6 Abrocoma_budini 100 0 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows These three variables show the percentage of each category of food that make the diet of that species. They should sum to 100, unless the authors made a typo or other entry error. To assert this, I’m going to create a new variable, total_diet. diet &lt;- diet %&gt;% mutate( &quot;total_diet&quot; = diet_vertebrate + diet_invertebrate + diet_plant ) diet #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 5 #&gt; binomial diet_plant diet_vertebrate diet_invertebrate total_diet #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys_latidens 100 0 0 100 #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys_sevia 78 3 19 100 #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomys_ruschii 88 1 11 100 #&gt; 4 Abrocoma_bennettii 100 0 0 100 #&gt; 5 Abrocoma_boliviensis 100 0 0 100 #&gt; 6 Abrocoma_budini 100 0 0 100 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows all(diet$total_diet == 100) #&gt; [1] TRUE # cool and good mutate() adds a variable to the table, and keeps all other variables. Sometimes you may want to just keep the new variable, and drop the other ones. That’s the job of mutate()’s twin sibling, transmute(). For example, I want to combine diet_invertebrate and diet_vertebrate together: diet %&gt;% transmute( &quot;diet_animal&quot; = diet_invertebrate + diet_vertebrate ) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 1 #&gt; diet_animal #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 0 #&gt; 2 22 #&gt; 3 12 #&gt; 4 0 #&gt; 5 0 #&gt; 6 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows You may want to keep some variables and drop others. You could pipe mutate() and select() to do so, or you could just pass the variables to keep to transmute(). diet %&gt;% transmute( &quot;diet_animal&quot; = diet_invertebrate + diet_vertebrate, diet_plant ) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 2 #&gt; diet_animal diet_plant #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 0 100 #&gt; 2 22 78 #&gt; 3 12 88 #&gt; 4 0 100 #&gt; 5 0 100 #&gt; 6 0 100 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows You can also refer to variables you’re creating to derive new variables from them as part of the same operation, this is not an issue. diet %&gt;% transmute( &quot;diet_animal&quot; = diet_invertebrate + diet_vertebrate, diet_plant, &quot;total_diet&quot; = diet_animal + diet_plant ) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 3 #&gt; diet_animal diet_plant total_diet #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 0 100 100 #&gt; 2 22 78 100 #&gt; 3 12 88 100 #&gt; 4 0 100 100 #&gt; 5 0 100 100 #&gt; 6 0 100 100 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows Sometimes, you may need to perform an operation based on the row number (I don’t have a good example in mind). tibble has a built-in function to do just that: phylacine %&gt;% select(binomial) %&gt;% tibble::rownames_to_column(var = &quot;row_nb&quot;) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 2 #&gt; row_nb binomial #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 1 Abditomys_latidens #&gt; 2 2 Abeomelomys_sevia #&gt; 3 3 Abrawayaomys_ruschii #&gt; 4 4 Abrocoma_bennettii #&gt; 5 5 Abrocoma_boliviensis #&gt; 6 6 Abrocoma_budini #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows 3.4.2 Summarise observations with summarise() mutate() applies operations to all observations in a table. By contrast, summarise() applies operations to groups of observations, and returns, er, summaries. The default grouping unit is the entire table: phylacine %&gt;% summarise( &quot;nb_species&quot; = n(), # counts observations &quot;nb_terrestrial&quot; = sum(terrestrial), &quot;nb_marine&quot; = sum(marine), &quot;nb_freshwater&quot; = sum(freshwater), &quot;nb_aerial&quot; = sum(aerial), &quot;mean_mass_g&quot; = mean(mass_g) ) #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 6 #&gt; nb_species nb_terrestrial nb_marine nb_freshwater nb_aerial mean_mass_g #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 5831 4575 135 156 1162 156882. Above you can see that bats account for a large portion of mammal species diversity (nb_aerial). How much exactly? Just as with mutate(), you can perform operations on the variables you just created, in the same statement: phylacine %&gt;% summarise( &quot;nb_species&quot; = n(), &quot;nb_aerial&quot; = sum(aerial), # bats &quot;prop_aerial&quot; = nb_aerial / nb_species ) #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3 #&gt; nb_species nb_aerial prop_aerial #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 5831 1162 0.199 One fifth! If the british spelling bothers you, summarize() exists and is strictly equivalent. Here’s a simple trick with logical (TRUE / FALSE) variables. Their sum is the count of observations that evaluate to TRUE (because TRUE is taken as 1 and FALSE as 0) and their mean is the proportion of TRUE observations. This can be exploited to count the number of observations that satisfy a condition: phylacine %&gt;% summarise( &quot;nb_species&quot; = n(), &quot;nb_megafauna&quot; = sum(mass_g &gt; 100000), &quot;p_megafauna&quot; = mean(mass_g &gt; 100000) ) #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3 #&gt; nb_species nb_megafauna p_megafauna #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 5831 302 0.0518 There are more summaries that just means and counts (see ?summarise() for some helpful functions). In fact, summarise can use any function or expression that evaluates to a single value or a vector of values. This includes base R max(), quantiles, etc. mutate() and transmute() can compute summaries as well, but they will return the summary once for each observation, in a new column. phylacine %&gt;% mutate(&quot;nb_species&quot; = n()) %&gt;% select(binomial, nb_species) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 2 #&gt; binomial nb_species #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys_latidens 5831 #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys_sevia 5831 #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomys_ruschii 5831 #&gt; 4 Abrocoma_bennettii 5831 #&gt; 5 Abrocoma_boliviensis 5831 #&gt; 6 Abrocoma_budini 5831 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows 3.4.3 Grouping observations by variables In most cases you don’t want to run summary operations on the entire set of observations, but instead on observations that share a common value, i.e. groups. For example, I want to run the summary displayed above, but for each Order of mammals. distinct() extracts all the unique values of a variable phylacine %&gt;% distinct(order) #&gt; # A tibble: 29 x 1 #&gt; order #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Rodentia #&gt; 2 Chiroptera #&gt; 3 Carnivora #&gt; 4 Pilosa #&gt; 5 Diprotodontia #&gt; 6 Cetartiodactyla #&gt; # … with 23 more rows I could work my way with what we have already seen, filtering observations (filter(order == \"Rodentia\")) and then pipeing the output to summarise(), and do it again for each Order. But that would be tedious. Instead, I can use group_by() to pool observations by order. phylacine %&gt;% group_by(order) #&gt; # A tibble: 5,831 x 24 #&gt; # Groups: order [29] #&gt; binomial order family genus species terrestrial marine freshwater aerial #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditom… Rode… Murid… Abdi… latide… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomel… Rode… Murid… Abeo… sevia 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 3 Abraway… Rode… Crice… Abra… ruschii 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 4 Abrocom… Rode… Abroc… Abro… bennet… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocom… Rode… Abroc… Abro… bolivi… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 6 Abrocom… Rode… Abroc… Abro… budini 1 0 0 0 #&gt; # … with 5,825 more rows, and 15 more variables: life_habit_method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # life_habit_source &lt;chr&gt;, mass_g &lt;dbl&gt;, mass_method &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # mass_source &lt;chr&gt;, mass_comparison &lt;chr&gt;, mass_comparison_source &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # island_endemicity &lt;chr&gt;, iucn_status &lt;chr&gt;, added_iucn_status &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # diet_plant &lt;dbl&gt;, diet_vertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, diet_invertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # diet_method &lt;chr&gt;, diet_source &lt;chr&gt; At first glance, nothing has changed, apart from an extra line of information in the output that tells me the observations have been grouped. But now here’s what happen if I run the same summarise() statement on an ungrouped and a grouped table phylacine %&gt;% summarise( &quot;n_species&quot; = n(), &quot;mean_mass_g&quot; = mean(mass_g) ) #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 2 #&gt; n_species mean_mass_g #&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 5831 156882. phylacine %&gt;% group_by(order) %&gt;% summarise( &quot;n_species&quot; = n(), &quot;mean_mass_g&quot; = mean(mass_g) ) #&gt; # A tibble: 29 x 3 #&gt; order n_species mean_mass_g #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Afrosoricida 57 306. #&gt; 2 Carnivora 313 47905. #&gt; 3 Cetartiodactyla 392 1854811. #&gt; 4 Chiroptera 1162 49.1 #&gt; 5 Cingulata 39 235529. #&gt; 6 Dasyuromorphia 74 748. #&gt; # … with 23 more rows I get one value for each group. Observations can be grouped by multiple variables, which will output a summary for every unique combination of groups. phylacine %&gt;% group_by(order, iucn_status) %&gt;% summarise( &quot;n_species&quot; = n() ) #&gt; # A tibble: 138 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: order [29] #&gt; order iucn_status n_species #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 Afrosoricida CR 1 #&gt; 2 Afrosoricida DD 4 #&gt; 3 Afrosoricida EN 7 #&gt; 4 Afrosoricida EP 2 #&gt; 5 Afrosoricida LC 32 #&gt; 6 Afrosoricida NT 3 #&gt; # … with 132 more rows Whenever you call summarise(), the last level of grouping is dropped. Note how in the output table above, observations are still grouped by order, and no longer by IUCN status. If I summarise observations again: phylacine %&gt;% group_by(order, iucn_status) %&gt;% summarise( &quot;n_species&quot; = n() ) %&gt;% summarise( &quot;n_species_2&quot; = n() ) #&gt; # A tibble: 29 x 2 #&gt; order n_species_2 #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; #&gt; 1 Afrosoricida 7 #&gt; 2 Carnivora 8 #&gt; 3 Cetartiodactyla 9 #&gt; 4 Chiroptera 8 #&gt; 5 Cingulata 5 #&gt; 6 Dasyuromorphia 7 #&gt; # … with 23 more rows I get the summary across orders, and the table is no longer grouped at all. This is useful to consider if you need to work on summaries across different levels of the data. For example, I would like to know how the species in each order are distributed between the different levels of threat in the IUCN classification. To get these proportions, I need to first get the count of each number of species in a level of threat inside an order, and divide that by the number of species in that order. phylacine %&gt;% group_by(order, iucn_status) %&gt;% summarise(&quot;n_order_iucn&quot; = n()) %&gt;% # grouping by iucn_status silently dropped mutate( &quot;n_order&quot; = sum(n_order_iucn), &quot;p_iucn&quot; = n_order_iucn / n_order ) #&gt; # A tibble: 138 x 5 #&gt; # Groups: order [29] #&gt; order iucn_status n_order_iucn n_order p_iucn #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Afrosoricida CR 1 57 0.0175 #&gt; 2 Afrosoricida DD 4 57 0.0702 #&gt; 3 Afrosoricida EN 7 57 0.123 #&gt; 4 Afrosoricida EP 2 57 0.0351 #&gt; 5 Afrosoricida LC 32 57 0.561 #&gt; 6 Afrosoricida NT 3 57 0.0526 #&gt; # … with 132 more rows 10.2% of Carnivores are Endangered (“EN”). 3.4.4 Grouped data and other dplyr verbs Grouping does not only affect the behaviour of summarise, but under circumstances, other verbs can (and will!) perform operations by groups. # Species with a higher mass than the mammal mean phylacine %&gt;% select(&quot;binomial&quot;, &quot;mass_g&quot;) %&gt;% filter(mass_g &gt; mean(mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) #&gt; # A tibble: 234 x 2 #&gt; binomial mass_g #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Alcelaphus_buselaphus 171002. #&gt; 2 Alces_alces 356998 #&gt; 3 Archaeoindris_fontoynonti 160000 #&gt; 4 Arctocephalus_pusillus 178500 #&gt; 5 Arctodus_simus 709500 #&gt; 6 Balaena_mysticetus 100000000 #&gt; # … with 228 more rows # Species with a higher mass than the mean in their order phylacine %&gt;% group_by(order) %&gt;% select(&quot;binomial&quot;, &quot;mass_g&quot;) %&gt;% filter(mass_g &gt; mean(mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) #&gt; # A tibble: 890 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: order [27] #&gt; order binomial mass_g #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Chiroptera Acerodon_celebensis 390 #&gt; 2 Chiroptera Acerodon_humilis 600. #&gt; 3 Chiroptera Acerodon_jubatus 1075 #&gt; 4 Chiroptera Acerodon_leucotis 513. #&gt; 5 Chiroptera Acerodon_mackloti 470. #&gt; 6 Rodentia Aeretes_melanopterus 732. #&gt; # … with 884 more rows # Largest mammal phylacine %&gt;% select(binomial, mass_g) %&gt;% slice_max(mass_g) #&gt; # A tibble: 1 x 2 #&gt; binomial mass_g #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Balaenoptera_musculus 190000000 # Largest species in each order phylacine %&gt;% group_by(order) %&gt;% select(binomial, mass_g) %&gt;% slice_max(mass_g) #&gt; # A tibble: 30 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: order [29] #&gt; order binomial mass_g #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Afrosoricida Plesiorycteropus_madagascariensis 13220 #&gt; 2 Carnivora Mirounga_leonina 1600000 #&gt; 3 Cetartiodactyla Balaenoptera_musculus 190000000 #&gt; 4 Chiroptera Acerodon_jubatus 1075 #&gt; 5 Cingulata Glyptodon_clavipes 2000000 #&gt; 6 Dasyuromorphia Thylacinus_cynocephalus 30000 #&gt; # … with 24 more rows To avoid grouped operations, you can simply drop grouping with ungroup(). 3.5 Working with multiple tables 3.5.1 Binding tables dplyr introduces bind_rows() and bind_cols(), which are equivalent to base R rbind() and cbind(), with a few extra feature. They are faster, and can bind many tables at once, and bind data frames with vectors or lists. bind_rows() has an option to pass a variable specifying which dataset each observation originates from. porpoises &lt;- phylacine %&gt;% filter(family == &quot;Phocoenidae&quot;) %&gt;% select(binomial, iucn_status) echidnas &lt;- phylacine %&gt;% filter(family == &quot;Tachyglossidae&quot;) %&gt;% select(binomial, iucn_status) bind_rows( &quot;porpoise&quot; = porpoises, &quot;echidna&quot; = echidnas, .id = &quot;kind&quot; ) #&gt; # A tibble: 13 x 3 #&gt; kind binomial iucn_status #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 porpoise Neophocaena_asiaeorientalis VU #&gt; 2 porpoise Neophocaena_phocaenoides VU #&gt; 3 porpoise Phocoena_dioptrica DD #&gt; 4 porpoise Phocoena_phocoena LC #&gt; 5 porpoise Phocoena_sinus CR #&gt; 6 porpoise Phocoena_spinipinnis DD #&gt; # … with 7 more rows 3.5.2 Combining variables of two tables with mutating joins Mutating joins are tailored to combine tables that share a set of observations but have different variables. As an example, let’s split the phylacine dataset in two smaller datasets, one containing information on diet and one on the dominant habitat. diet &lt;- phylacine %&gt;% select(binomial, diet_plant:diet_invertebrate) %&gt;% slice(1:5) diet #&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 4 #&gt; binomial diet_plant diet_vertebrate diet_invertebrate #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys_latidens 100 0 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys_sevia 78 3 19 #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomys_ruschii 88 1 11 #&gt; 4 Abrocoma_bennettii 100 0 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocoma_boliviensis 100 0 0 life_habit &lt;- phylacine %&gt;% select(binomial, terrestrial:aerial) %&gt;% slice(1:3, 6:7) life_habit #&gt; # A tibble: 5 x 5 #&gt; binomial terrestrial marine freshwater aerial #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditomys_latidens 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomelomys_sevia 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 3 Abrawayaomys_ruschii 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 4 Abrocoma_budini 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 5 Abrocoma_cinerea 1 0 0 0 The two datasets each contain 5 species, the first three are shared, and the two last differ between the two. intersect(diet$binomial, life_habit$binomial) #&gt; [1] &quot;Abditomys_latidens&quot; &quot;Abeomelomys_sevia&quot; &quot;Abrawayaomys_ruschii&quot; setdiff(diet$binomial, life_habit$binomial) #&gt; [1] &quot;Abrocoma_bennettii&quot; &quot;Abrocoma_boliviensis&quot; To use mutate-joins, both tables need to have a key, a variable that identifies each observation. Here, that would be binomial, the sepcies names. If your table doesn’t have such a key and the rows between the tables match one another, remember you can create a row number variable easily with tibble::column_to_rownames(). inner_join(diet, life_habit, by = &quot;binomial&quot;) #&gt; # A tibble: 3 x 8 #&gt; binomial diet_plant diet_vertebrate diet_invertebra… terrestrial marine #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Abditom… 100 0 0 1 0 #&gt; 2 Abeomel… 78 3 19 1 0 #&gt; 3 Abraway… 88 1 11 1 0 #&gt; # … with 2 more variables: freshwater &lt;dbl&gt;, aerial &lt;dbl&gt; inner_join combined the variables, and dropped the observations that weren’t matched between the two tables.

This includes other tibbles, as well as model objects and plots. NB: Nesting data is done using tidyr::nest, which is different from the similarly named tidyr::nesting. The example below shows how Phylacine data can be converted into a nested tibble. # get phylacine data data = read_csv(&quot;data/phylacine_traits.csv&quot;) data = data %&gt;% `colnames&lt;-`(str_to_lower(colnames(.))) %&gt;% `colnames&lt;-`(str_remove(colnames(.), &quot;(.1.2)&quot;)) %&gt;% `colnames&lt;-`(str_replace_all(colnames(.), &quot;\\\\.&quot;, &quot;_&quot;)) # nest phylacine by order nested_data = data %&gt;% group_by(order) %&gt;% nest() nested_data #&gt; # A tibble: 29 x 2 #&gt; # Groups: order [29] #&gt; order data #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; #&gt; 1 Rodentia &lt;tibble [2,306 × 23]&gt; #&gt; 2 Chiroptera &lt;tibble [1,162 × 23]&gt; #&gt; 3 Carnivora &lt;tibble [313 × 23]&gt; #&gt; 4 Pilosa &lt;tibble [34 × 23]&gt; #&gt; 5 Diprotodontia &lt;tibble [183 × 23]&gt; #&gt; 6 Cetartiodactyla &lt;tibble [392 × 23]&gt; #&gt; # … with 23 more rows # get column class sapply(nested_data, class) #&gt; order data #&gt; &quot;character&quot; &quot;list&quot; The data is now a nested data frame. The class of each of its columns is respectively, a character (order name) and a list (the data of all mammals in the corresponding order). While nest can be used without first grouping the tibble, it’s just much easier to group first. 4.1.2 Unnesting data A nested tibble can be converted back into the original, or into a processed form, using tidyr::unnest. The original groups are retained. # use unnest to recover the original data frame unnest(nested_data, cols = &quot;data&quot;) %&gt;% head() #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 24 #&gt; # Groups: order [1] #&gt; order binomial family genus species terrestrial marine freshwater aerial #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 Rode… Abditom… Murid… Abdi… latide… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 2 Rode… Abeomel… Murid… Abeo… sevia 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 3 Rode… Abraway… Crice… Abra… ruschii 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 4 Rode… Abrocom… Abroc… Abro… bennet… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 5 Rode… Abrocom… Abroc… Abro… bolivi… 1 0 0 0 #&gt; 6 Rode… Abrocom… Abroc… Abro… budini 1 0 0 0 #&gt; # … with 15 more variables: life_habit_method &lt;chr&gt;, life_habit_source &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # mass_g &lt;dbl&gt;, mass_method &lt;chr&gt;, mass_source &lt;chr&gt;, mass_comparison &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # mass_comparison_source &lt;chr&gt;, island_endemicity &lt;chr&gt;, iucn_status &lt;chr&gt;, #&gt; # added_iucn_status &lt;chr&gt;, diet_plant &lt;dbl&gt;, diet_vertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, #&gt; # diet_invertebrate &lt;dbl&gt;, diet_method &lt;chr&gt;, diet_source &lt;chr&gt; # unnesting preserves groups groups(unnest(nested_data, cols = &quot;data&quot;)) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; order The unnest_longer and unnest_wider variants of unnest are maturing functions, that is, not in their final form. They allow interesting variations on unnesting — these are shown here but advised against. Unnest the data first, and then convert it to the form needed. 4.1.3 Working with list columns The class of a list column is list, and working with list columns (and lists, and list-like objects such as vectors) makes iteration necessary, since this is one of the only ways to operate on lists. Two examples are shown below when getting the class and number of rows of the nested tibbles in the list column. # how many rows in each nested tibble? for (i in seq_along(nested_data$data[1:10])) { print(nrow(nested_data$data[[i]])) } #&gt; [1] 2306 #&gt; [1] 1162 #&gt; [1] 313 #&gt; [1] 34 #&gt; [1] 183 #&gt; [1] 392 #&gt; [1] 460 #&gt; [1] 57 #&gt; [1] 20 #&gt; [1] 465 # what is the class of each element? lapply(X = nested_data$data[1:3], FUN = class) #&gt; [[1]] #&gt; [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; #&gt; #&gt; [[2]] #&gt; [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; #&gt; #&gt; [[3]] #&gt; [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Functionals The second example uses lapply, and this is a functional. Functionals are functions that take another function as one of their arguments. Base R functionals include the *apply family of functions: apply, lapply, vapply and so on. 4.2 Iteration with map The tidyverse replaces traditional loop-based iteration with functionals from the purrr package. Why use purrr A good reason to use purrr functionals instead of base R functionals is their consistent and clear naming, which always indicates how they should be used. This is explained in the examples below. How map is different from for and lapply are best explained in the Advanced R Book. 4.2.1 Basic use of map map works very similarly to lapply, where .x is object on whose elements to apply the function .f. # get the number of rows in data map(.x = nested_data$data, .f = nrow) %&gt;% head() #&gt;

In the example, the dplyr::mutate function is used to add three columns to the nested tibble: the number of rows, the mean mileage, and the name of the first car. In each of these cases, the vectors added are generated using purrr functions. # get the number of rows per dataframe, the mean mileage, and the first car nested_data = nested_data %&gt;% mutate( # use the int return to get the number of rows n_rows = map_int(data, nrow), # double return for mean mileage mean_mass = map_dbl(data, function(df) {mean(df$mass_g)}), # character return to get the heaviest member first_animal = map_chr(data, function(df) { arrange(df, -mass_g) %&gt;% .$binomial %&gt;% first()} ) ) # examine the output nested_data #&gt; # A tibble: 29 x 5 #&gt; # Groups: order [29] #&gt; order data n_rows mean_mass first_animal #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; #&gt; 1 Rodentia &lt;tibble [2,306 × 23]&gt; 2306 486. Neochoerus_aesopi #&gt; 2 Chiroptera &lt;tibble [1,162 × 23]&gt; 1162 49.1 Acerodon_jubatus #&gt; 3 Carnivora &lt;tibble [313 × 23]&gt; 313 47905. Mirounga_leonina #&gt; 4 Pilosa &lt;tibble [34 × 23]&gt; 34 785958. Megatherium_americanum #&gt; 5 Diprotodontia &lt;tibble [183 × 23]&gt; 183 40202. Diprotodon_optatum #&gt; 6 Cetartiodactyla &lt;tibble [392 × 23]&gt; 392 1854811. Balaenoptera_musculus #&gt; # … with 23 more rows 4.2.5 Selective mapping using map variants map_at and map_if work like other *_at and *_if functions. Here, map_if is used to run a linear model only on those tibbles which have sufficient data. The predicate is specified by .p. In this example, the nested tibble is given a new column using dplyr::mutate, where the data to be added is a mixed list. # split data by order number and run an lm only if there are more than 100 rows nested_data = nest(data, data = -order) nested_data = mutate(nested_data, model = map_if(.x = data, # this is the predicate # which elements should be operated on? .p = function(x){ nrow(x) &gt; 100 }, # this is the function to use # if the predicate is satisfied .f = function(x){ lm(mass_g ~ diet_plant, data = x) })) # check the data structure nested_data %&gt;% head() #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 3 #&gt; order data model #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt; #&gt; 1 Rodentia &lt;tibble [2,306 × 23]&gt; &lt;lm&gt; #&gt; 2 Chiroptera &lt;tibble [1,162 × 23]&gt; &lt;lm&gt; #&gt; 3 Carnivora &lt;tibble [313 × 23]&gt; &lt;lm&gt; #&gt; 4 Pilosa &lt;tibble [34 × 23]&gt; &lt;tibble [34 × 23]&gt; #&gt; 5 Diprotodontia &lt;tibble [183 × 23]&gt; &lt;lm&gt; #&gt; 6 Cetartiodactyla &lt;tibble [392 × 23]&gt; &lt;lm&gt; Some elements of the column model are tibbles, which have not been operated on because they have fewer than 100 rows (species). The remaining elements are lm objects. 4.3 More map variants map also has variants along the axis of how many elements are operated upon. map2 operates on two vectors or list-like elements, and returns a single list as output, while pmap operates on a list of list-like elements. The output has as many elements as the input lists, which must be of the same length. 4.3.1 Mapping over two inputs with map2 map2 has the same variants as map, allowing for different return types. Here map2_int returns an integer vector. # consider 2 vectors and replicate the simple vector addition using map2 map2_int(.x = 1:5, .y = 6:10, .f = sum) #&gt; [1] 7 9 11 13 15 map2 doesn’t have _at and _if variants. One use case for map2 is to deal with both a list element and its index, as shown in the example. This may be necessary when the list index is removed in a split or nest. This can also be done with imap, where the index is referred to as .y. # make a named list for this example this_list = list(a = &quot;first letter&quot;, b = &quot;second letter&quot;) # a not particularly useful example map2(this_list, names(this_list), function(x, y) { glue::glue(&#39;{x} : {y}&#39;) }) #&gt; $a #&gt; first letter : a #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; second letter : b # imap can also do this imap(this_list, function(x, .y){ glue::glue(&#39;{x} : {.y}&#39;) }) #&gt; $a #&gt; first letter : a #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; second letter : b 4.3.2 Mapping over multiple inputs with pmap pmap instead operates on a list of multiple list-like objects, and also comes with the same return type variants as map. The example shows both aspects of pmap using pmap_chr. # operate on three different lists list_01 = as.list(1:3) list_02 = as.list(letters[1:3]) list_03 = as.list(rainbow(3)) # print a few statements pmap_chr(list(list_01, list_02, list_03), function(l1, l2, l3){ glue::glue(&#39;number {l1}, letter {l2}, colour {l3}&#39;) }) #&gt; [1] &quot;number 1, letter a, colour #FF0000FF&quot; #&gt; [2] &quot;number 2, letter b, colour #00FF00FF&quot; #&gt; [3] &quot;number 3, letter c, colour #0000FFFF&quot; 4.4 Combining map variants and tidyverse functions The example below shows a relatively complex data manipulation pipeline. Such pipelines must either be thought through carefully in advance, or checked for required output on small subsets of data, so as not to consume excessive system resources. In the pipeline: The tibble becomes a nested dataframe by order (using tidyr::nest), If there are enough data points (&gt; 100), a linear model of mass ~ plant diet is fit (using purrr::map_if, and stats::lm), The model coefficients are extracted if the model was fit (using purrr::map &amp; dplyr::case_when), The model coefficients are converted to data for plotting (using purrr::map, tibble::tibble, &amp; tidyr::pivot_wider), The raw data is plotted along with the model fit, taking the title from the nested data frame (using purrr::pmap &amp; ggplot2::ggplot). nested_data &lt;- data %&gt;% tidyr::nest(data = -order) %&gt;% mutate(data, model = map_if(.x = data, # this is the predicate # which elements should be operated on? .p = function(x){ nrow(x) &gt; 100 }, # this is the function to use # if the predicate is satisfied .f = function(x){ lm(mass_g ~ diet_plant, data = x) })) %&gt;% mutate(m_coef = map(model, # use case when to get model coefficients function(x) { dplyr::case_when( &quot;lm&quot; %in% class(x) ~ { list(coef(x)) }, TRUE ~ { list(c(NA,NA)) } )}), # work on the two element double vector of coefficients m_coef = map(m_coef, function(x){ tibble(coef = unlist(x), param = c(&quot;intercept&quot;, &quot;diet_plant&quot;)) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;param&quot;, values_from = &quot;coef&quot;) }), # work on the raw data and the coefficients plot = pmap(list(order, data, m_coef), function(ord, x, y){ # pay no attention to the ggplot for now ggplot2::ggplot()+ geom_point(data = x, aes(diet_plant, mass_g), size = 0.1)+ scale_y_log10()+ labs(title = glue::glue(&#39;order: {ord}&#39;)) }) ) 4.5 A return to map variants Lists are often nested, that is, a list element may itself be a list. It is possible to map a function over elements as a specific depth. In the example, phylacine is split by order, and then by IUCN status, creating a two-level list, with the second layer operated on. # use map to make a 2 level list this_list = split(data, data$order) %&gt;% map(function(df){ split(df, df$iucn_status) }) # map over the second level to count the number of # species in each order in each IUCN class # display only the first element map_depth(this_list[1], 2, nrow) #&gt; $Afrosoricida #&gt; $Afrosoricida$CR #&gt; [1] 1 #&gt; #&gt; $Afrosoricida$DD #&gt; [1] 4 #&gt; #&gt; $Afrosoricida$EN #&gt; [1] 7 #&gt; #&gt; $Afrosoricida$EP #&gt; [1] 2 #&gt; #&gt; $Afrosoricida$LC #&gt; [1] 32 #&gt; #&gt; $Afrosoricida$NT #&gt; [1] 3 #&gt; #&gt; $Afrosoricida$VU #&gt; [1] 8 4.5.1 Iteration without a return map and its variants have a return type, which is either a list or a vector. However, it is often necessary to iterate a function over a list-like object for that function’s side effects, such as printing a message to screen, plotting a series of figures, or saving to file. walk is the function for this task. It has only the variants walk2, iwalk, and pwalk, whose logic is similar to map2, imap, and pmap. In the example, the function applied to each list element is intended to print a message. this_list = split(data, data$order) iwalk(this_list, function(df, .y){ print(glue::glue(&#39;{nrow(df)} species in order {.y}&#39;)) }) #&gt; 57 species in order Afrosoricida #&gt; 313 species in order Carnivora #&gt; 392 species in order Cetartiodactyla #&gt; 1162 species in order Chiroptera #&gt; 39 species in order Cingulata #&gt; 74 species in order Dasyuromorphia #&gt; 2 species in order Dermoptera #&gt; 97 species in order Didelphimorphia #&gt; 183 species in order Diprotodontia #&gt; 465 species in order Eulipotyphla #&gt; 5 species in order Hyracoidea #&gt; 94 species in order Lagomorpha #&gt; 3 species in order Litopterna #&gt; 19 species in order Macroscelidea #&gt; 1 species in order Microbiotheria #&gt; 7 species in order Monotremata #&gt; 2 species in order Notoryctemorphia #&gt; 3 species in order Notoungulata #&gt; 7 species in order Paucituberculata #&gt; 24 species in order Peramelemorphia #&gt; 29 species in order Perissodactyla #&gt; 9 species in order Pholidota #&gt; 34 species in order Pilosa #&gt; 460 species in order Primates #&gt; 18 species in order Proboscidea #&gt; 2306 species in order Rodentia #&gt; 20 species in order Scandentia #&gt; 5 species in order Sirenia #&gt; 1 species in order Tubulidentata 4.5.2 Modify rather than map When the return type is expected to be the same as the input type, that is, a list returning a list, or a character vector returning the same, modify can help with keeping strictly to those expectations. In the example, simply adding 2 to each vector element produces an error, because the output is a numeric, or double. modify helps ensure some type safety in this way. vec = as.integer(1:10) tryCatch( expr = { # this is what we want you to look at modify(vec, function(x) { (x + 2) }) }, # do not pay attention to this error = function(e){ print(toString(e)) } ) #&gt; [1] &quot;Error: Can&#39;t coerce element 1 from a double to a integer\\n&quot; Converting the output to an integer, which was the original input type, serves as a solution. modify(vec, function(x) { as.integer(x + 2) }) #&gt; [1] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 A note on invoke invoke used to be a wrapper around do.call, and can still be found with its family of functions in purrr. It is however retired in favour of functionality already present in map and rlang::exec, the latter of which will be covered in another session. 4.6 Other functions for working with lists purrr has a number of functions to work with lists, especially lists that are not nested list-columns in a tibble. 4.6.1 Filtering lists Lists can be filtered on any predicate using keep, while the special case compact is applied when the empty elements of a list are to be filtered out. discard is the opposite of keep, and keeps only elements not satisfying a condition. Again, the predicate is specified by .p. # a list containing numbers this_list = list(a = 1, b = -1, c = 2, d = NULL, e = NA) # remove the empty element # this must be done before using keep on the list this_list = compact(this_list) # use discard to remove the NA this_list = discard(this_list, .p =is.na) # keep list elements which are positive keep(this_list, .p = function(x){ x &gt; 0 }) #&gt; $a #&gt; [1] 1 #&gt; #&gt; $c #&gt; [1] 2 head_while is bit of an odd case, which returns all elements of a list-like object in sequence until the first one fails to satisfy a predicate, specified by .p. 1:10 %&gt;% head_while(.p = function(x) x &lt; 5) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 4.6.2 Summarising lists The purrr functions every, some, has_element, detect, detect_index, and vec_depth help determine whether a list passes a certain logical test or not. These are seldom used and are not discussed here. 4.6.3 Reduction and accumulation reduce helps combine elements along a list using a specific function. Consider the example below where list elements are concatenated into a single vector. this_list = list(a = 1:3, b = 3:4, c = 5:10) reduce(this_list, c) #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 This can also be applied to data frames. Consider some random samples of mtcars, each with only 5 cars removed. The objective is to find the cars present in all 10 samples. The way reduce works in the example below is to take the first element and find its intersection with the second, and to take the result and find its intersection with the third and so on. # sample mtcars mtcars = as_tibble(mtcars, rownames = &quot;car&quot;) sampled_data = map(1:10, function(x){ sample_n(mtcars, nrow(mtcars)-5) }) # get cars which appear in all samples sampled_data = reduce(sampled_data, dplyr::inner_join) accumulate works very similarly, except it retains the intermediate products. The first element is retained as is. accumulate2 and reduce2 work on two lists, following the same logic as map2 etc. Both functions can be used in much more complex ways than demonstrated here. # make a list this_list = list(a = 1:3, b = 3:6, c = 5:10, d = c(1,2,5,10,12)) # a multiple accumulate can help accumulate(this_list, union, .dir = &quot;forward&quot;) #&gt; $a #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 #&gt; #&gt; $c #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 #&gt; #&gt; $d #&gt; [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 4.6.4 Miscellaneous operation purrr offers a few more functions to work with lists (or list like objects). prepend works very similarly to append, except it adds to the head of a list. splice adds multiple objects together in a list. splice will break the existing list structure of input lists. flatten has a similar behaviour, and converts a list of vectors or list of lists to a single list-like object. flatten_* options allow the output type to be specified. this_list = list(a = rep(&quot;a&quot;, 3), b = rep(&quot;b&quot;, 4)) this_list #&gt; $a #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; #&gt; #&gt; $b #&gt; [1] &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; # use flatten chr to get a character vector flatten_chr(this_list) #&gt; [1] &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; &quot;b&quot; transpose shifts the index order in multi-level lists. This is seen in the example, where the iucn_status goes from being the index of the second level to the index of the first. this_list = split(data, data$order) %&gt;% map(function(df) {split(df, df$iucn_status)}) # from a list of lists where species are divided by order and then # iucn_status, this is now a list of lists where species are # divided by status and then order transpose(this_list[1]) 4.7 Lists of ggplots with patchwork The patchwork library helps compose ggplots, which will be properly introduced in the next session. patchwork usually works on lists of ggplots, which can come from a standalone list, or from a list column in a nested dataframe. The example below shows the latter, with the data data frame from earlier. # use patchwork on list patchwork::wrap_plots(nested_data$plot[1:5]) "],

So well-known, in fact, that people often know ggplot2 before they get to know about the tidyverse. We will first learn about the philosophy behind ggplot2 and then follow that recipe to build more and more customized plots through some examples. 5.1 Introduction 5.1.1 What is ggplot2 and why use it? There are many ways of making graphics in base R. For example, plot is used for scatterplots, hist is used for histograms, boxplot is self-explanatory, and image can be used for heatmaps. However, those functions are often developed by different people with different logics in mind, which makes them often inconsistent with each other: one has to learn what the arguments of each function are. ggplot2 is aimed at solving this problem and making plotting flexible, allowing to build any graph using a common standard, the grammar of graphics (which is what “gg” stands for). By building on a single reference grammar, ggplot2 therefore fits nicely into the tidyverse, and as part of it, it also follows the same rule as tidyr, dplyr or purrr, making the integration between all those packages very smooth. 5.1.2 What is the grammar of graphics? The grammar of graphics is a system of rules on how to structure plots such that almost any graph can be made through combinations of a limited set of simpler elements, just as you can make any sentence by combining together letters from an alphabet (hence the term “grammar”). ggplot2 is the implementation of this philosophy in R, and it is this modularity that underlies its flexibility. ggplot2 comes with a limited set of elements, or layers, that you can pick and combine into an impressive variety of graphics, all based on the same syntax. But what are those elements? Here is the backbone of a ggplot statement (I will from now on use “ggplot” to refer to an object of class ggplot, the output of the ggplot function and the object that contains our graphic), taken from the book R for Data Science: ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;( mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;), stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, position = &lt;POSITION&gt; ) + &lt;COORDINATE_FUNCTION&gt; + &lt;FACET_FUNCTION&gt; This pseudocode snippet illustrates a fundamental aspect of ggplot2, which is that plots are built by successive commands, each corresponding to a layer, assembled together using the + operator. This might seem less practical than having a plot made in a single call to the plot function, but it is this modularity that actually gives ggplot2 its flexibility. This means that in ggplot2 you will typically need multiple commands to make a plot. All ggplots are made of at least the two following basic ingredients: A call to the ggplot function, with the relevant data frame passed to it (this data frame contains our data to plot) A geom layer, specifying the type of plot to be shown. Variables from the data are mapped onto the graphical properties of this layer, called aesthetics. That means that: library(tidyverse) ggplot(mtcars) will not show anything. A ggplot object is there, but it has no layers yet. Plots can then be customized with statistical transformations, re-positioning, changes in coordinate system, facetting, and more. We will now go through the different elements. 5.2 But first, the data In this chapter we will use the data from bacterial_experiment.csv, forged by Annie for us to use. This dataset resembles Annie’s experiment where she created mutator strains of bacteria (that is, bacteria that mutate at a much higher rate than usual) and tracked their growth through time and at different concentrations of an agent supposed to activate the full “mutation potential” of those strains. data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/bacterial_experiment.csv&quot;) data #&gt; # A tibble: 310 x 7 #&gt; strain assay conc ratio time cfu OD600 #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 strain 1 test 1 1 8.58 T0 320000000 0.319 #&gt; 2 strain 1 test 1 1 8.58 T1 1293846908 0.911 #&gt; 3 strain 1 test 1 1 6.11 T0 370110830 0.287 #&gt; 4 strain 1 test 1 1 6.11 T1 1480443320 0.9 #&gt; 5 strain 1 test 1 1 11.8 T0 377928804 0.321 #&gt; 6 strain 1 test 1 1 11.8 T1 1511715216 0.914 #&gt; # … with 304 more rows The different strains of bacteria were grown in two different assays, whose details are irrelevant for the purpose of this tutorial. cfu is the number of colony forming units while OD600 is the optical density at 600nm wavelength; both are estimates of bacterial population density. ratio represents the ratio in mutants between two time points, T0 and T1 (encoded in time). In this table, the unit of observation is the time point (T0 and T1 are on different rows), therefore the values of ratio, which are attributed to each T0-T1 pair, are duplicated to yield one value per time point. To make our life easier with later plotting and to stay within the tidy spirit of the tidyverse (where one table should have one unit of observation), we use the tools we have already learnt to make a ratio-wise table: data2 &lt;- data %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;time&quot;, values_from = c(&quot;cfu&quot;, &quot;OD600&quot;)) data2 #&gt; # A tibble: 155 x 8 #&gt; strain assay conc ratio cfu_T0 cfu_T1 OD600_T0 OD600_T1 #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 strain 1 test 1 1 8.58 320000000 1293846908 0.319 0.911 #&gt; 2 strain 1 test 1 1 6.11 370110830 1480443320 0.287 0.9 #&gt; 3 strain 1 test 1 1 11.8 377928804 1511715216 0.321 0.914 #&gt; 4 strain 1 test 1 1 7.78 369871771 1479487084 0.299 0.92 #&gt; 5 strain 1 test 1 5 10.5 380000000 1505539596 0.295 0.922 #&gt; 6 strain 1 test 1 5 8.29 322488344 1289953376 0.275 0.88 #&gt; # … with 149 more rows 5.3 Geom layers The geom object is the core visual layer of a plot, and it defines the type of plot being made, e.g. geom_point will add points, geom_line will add lines, etc. There are tons of geoms to pick from, depending on the type of figure you want to make, and new geoms are regularly added in extensions to ggplot2 (links at the end of this chapter). All geoms have aesthetics, or graphical parameters, that may be specified. Those include x and y coordinates, color, transparency, etc. Some aesthetics are mandatory for some geoms, e.g. geom_point needs x and y coordinates of the points to plot. Other aesthetics are optional, e.g. if color is unspecified, all the points will look black. Some geoms even have no mandatory aesthetics, such as geom_abline, which will plot a diagonal running through the origin and with slope one if its intercept and slope are unspecified. Aesthetics are specified in two ways: (1) variables from the data can be mapped to them using the aes function, or (2) they can take fixed values. Some of the main aesthetics to know, besides geom-specific coordinates (e.g. x, y), include: color, fill (color used to fill surfaces), group (used e.g. to plot multiple lines with similar aspect on the same plot), alpha (transparency), size, linetype, shape, and label (for showing text). Note that in most functions across the tidyverse both US and UK English can be used, e.g. colour is also a valid aesthetics, and dplyr::summarize is equivalent to dplyr::summarise. 5.3.1 Mapping variables to aesthetics Variables are mapped to aesthetics using the aes function. Here is a basic scatterplot example showing ratio against conc: ggplot(data2) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = conc, y = ratio)) We can use the other available aesthetics to show more aspects of the data, or to see patterns a bit more clearly. For example, we can color-code the points based on their strain, and change their shape based on the type of assay: ggplot(data2) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain, shape = assay)) 5.3.2 Fixed aesthetics Fixed graphical parameters (i.e. that are not mapped to a variable) should be added as arguments of the geom outside the aes command. For example, to make all points a little bigger and more transparent, we can use ggplot(data2) + geom_point( mapping = aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain, shape = assay), size = 2, alpha = 0.6 ) 5.3.3 Statistical transformation Statistical transformations, or stat functions, can be applied to the data within a geom call. Actually, statistical transformations are always applied within a geom call, but most of the time the identity function is used. To illustrate, consider the following plot showing a distribution of ratio for different strains: ggplot(data2) + stat_density(aes(x = ratio, fill = strain), alpha = 0.5) Here, the density axis is not part of the original dataset data2; it was computed from the data, for each value of ratio, by using a density-estimation algorithm. This shows that stat_density, and not stat_identity, is the default stat used in geom_density. Every geom comes with its default stat. Similarly, stat functions can be used in place of geom because every stat has a default geom associated to it. So, we can call: ggplot(data2) + stat_density(aes(x = ratio, fill = strain), alpha = 0.5) which has geom_density as default geom. It is possible to override the default stat using the stat argument of geom, and conversely, it is possible to change the default geom associated with a given stat. For example, say we want to plot our densities as points. Then, ggplot(data2) + stat_density(aes(x = ratio, color = strain), alpha = 0.5, geom = &quot;point&quot;) does the job (note that we replaced fill with color because our points do not have a surface to fill). Note that default geom-stat combinations are usually well thought of (density plots are a good example). Therefore, it is often not necessary to play with stats. It may matter in some specific cases, e.g. when using geom_bar, but we do not cover that here (you can check out the dedicated chapter in R for Data Science for an example). 5.3.4 Position The position argument of geoms allows to adjust the positioning of the geom’s elements. It has a few variants, but the possibilities depend on the geom used. We illustrate those available to geom_bar. By default, geom_bar uses the stat_count statistical transformation, meaning that it will show us the number of observations into each category of a factor, e.g. strain, splitted into categories of another factor, e.g. assay: ggplot(data2) + geom_bar(aes(x = strain, fill = assay)) If we wanted to visualize proportions instead of numbers, we could use the fill value of the position argument: ggplot(data2) + geom_bar(aes(x = strain, fill = assay), position = &quot;fill&quot;) Alternatively we could use the dodge option to show the different categories side-by-side: ggplot(data2) + geom_bar(aes(x = strain, fill = assay), position = &quot;dodge&quot;) Those are only two examples of what can be done. Just remember that position exists and look into the examples in the documentation of your geom of interest to see what position adjustments are available! 5.3.5 Other geoms The most common geoms you may encounter are: geom_point for scatter plots and geom_jitter for the dodge equivalent geom_bar for a barplot geom_text for a scatter plot of labels geom_histogram and geom_density, self-explanatory geom_boxplot and geom_violin geom_line and geom_path geom_segment, geom_hline, geom_vline and geom_abline that may come handy geom_tile for heatmaps There are litterally tons of geoms and ways to use them. In this tutorial, we emphasize the understanding of the grammar and how to assemble the different ingredients, rather than the ingredients themselves. For this reason, here we are not giving an exhaustive sample of each geom and what they look like. So, keep this list of names in mind as a reminder that whatever plot you want to make, there probably is a geom for it. To explore a gallery of examples, check out the R graph gallery. 5.3.6 Extra on aesthetics It is possible to use the + operators, not only to add layers but also to modify previous layers. You might wonder why not to write the layer correctly in the first place. This starts making more sense in cases e.g. where a plot can be modified in different ways. For example, consider this plot: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio)) + geom_point() We may want to color-code the points based on strain or assay, or both, thus requiring two plots building on this single one. An important property of ggplot objects is that they can be assigned to variables, e.g. p &lt;- ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio)) + geom_point() Note that we have to call the object p for the plot to be displayed. If we just assign the plot to p, the plot does not show. We can subsequently add differential aesthetics to different copies of p: p + aes(color = strain) p + aes(color = assay) 5.3.7 Plot-wide aesthetics and multiple geoms In the last example, by adding new aesthetics mapping to the ggplot using the + operator, we did not add these aesthetics specifically to the geom_point layer, but to all the geoms present in the plot. Similarly, one can pass aesthetic mappings to the ggplot command directly, not necessarily with the geom statement. This saves some typing when geoms taking the same aesthetics are used, e.g. geom_violin and geom_jitter: ggplot(data2, aes(x = factor(conc), y = ratio)) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(width = 0.1) # x is made categorical here This shows a nice example of multiple geoms combined in a single plot. If, however, the aesthetics used in some geoms are geom-specific, better pass them to their respective geom. For example, if you want to color only the points by not the violins, use: ggplot(data2, aes(x = factor(conc), y = ratio)) + geom_violin() + geom_jitter(mapping = aes(color = strain), width = 0.2) 5.3.8 Multiple geoms with different datasets Just as aesthetics can vary from geom to geom, so do datasets. In other words, the dataset does not have to be passed to the ggplot command necessarily, and can be passed to a geom instead, for example: ggplot() + geom_point(data2, mapping = aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) This means that different geoms can be based on different datasets. This allows quite some complexification of the plots and illustrates very well the usefulness of the other packages of the tidyverse. Say, for example, that we want to add to this plot a line going through the means at each value of conc. These mean values are not yet present in our dataset, and we need to come up with a mean-wise dataset. dplyr is our friend for this task: data3 &lt;- data2 %&gt;% group_by(conc, strain) %&gt;% summarize(ratio = mean(ratio)) data3 #&gt; # A tibble: 24 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: conc [8] #&gt; conc strain ratio #&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&gt; 1 1 control 2.21 #&gt; 2 1 strain 1 7.09 #&gt; 3 1 strain 2 9.16 #&gt; 4 5 control 2.50 #&gt; 5 5 strain 1 7.17 #&gt; 6 5 strain 2 6.89 #&gt; # … with 18 more rows Let us now add an extra layer of information based on this latest, summary dataset: ggplot() + geom_point(data = data2, mapping = aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) + geom_line(data = data3, mapping = aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) Here, we could save some typing by writing: ggplot(data2, mapping = aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) + geom_point() + geom_line(data = data3) where geom_line inherits the same aesthetic mapping as geom_point. But then, you have to make sure that data3 contains all the aesthetics that the ggplot call expects to see in each of its geoms (here x, y and color). 5.4 Coordinate-system The default way that the plotting window is organized is with an orthogonal space with a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis. Use the coord commands to deviate from this. For example, coord_flip will revert the order of the axes: ggplot(data2, aes(x = factor(conc), y = ratio)) + geom_violin() + coord_flip() while coord_fixed will fix the aspect ratio between the axes, thus showing them on the same scale. For example, the following plot of the optical density between two time points, ggplot(data2, aes(x = OD600_T0, y = OD600_T1)) + geom_point() becomes: ggplot(data2, aes(x = OD600_T0, y = OD600_T1)) + geom_point() + coord_fixed() when both axes are shown on the same scale. Other coordinate systems exist, depending on the need, including coord_polar for radial plots or coord_quickmap, tailored at latitude-longitude plotting. 5.5 Facetting One of the most powerful features of ggplot2 is its easy-to-use way of splitting a plot into multiple subplots, or facets. There are two functions for facetting: facet_grid and facet_wrap. facet_grid will arrange the plot in rows and columns depending on variables that the user defines: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(strain ~ assay) Here the tilde (~) symbolizes a formula, a type of expression in R with a left and right-hand side, which here are interpreted as variables to use for rows and columns, respectively. If using only one variable for facetting, use . or nothing on the other side of the tilde. Note that facets are plotted on the same scale. We can use the scales argument to allow free scales, for example: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(strain ~ assay, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;) facet_wrap is similar to facet_grid, except that it does not organize the facets in rows and columns but rather as an array of facets that fill the screen by row, like when filling a matrix with numbers: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(strain ~ assay) where the position of the variables relative to the ~ becomes irrelevant. Note that a facetted ggplot is still one ggplot, not a combination of ggplots, which we will cover later. Custom-labelling the strips of the facets is done with the labeller argument. The way this is used is a little complicated, but essentially looks like this: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(strain ~ assay, labeller = labeller(.rows = label_both)) Here, the label_both function is applied to the variable facetting by row, which is strain. label_both tells the labeller to label the strips with the name of the variable (strain) followed by its value, separated by a colon. We will not cover labelling in details here, but keep in mind that the labeller argument is what to play with, and that it takes the output of the labeller function as input, which itself takes labelling functions, such as label_both, as arguments. Other labelling functions include label_value, which just shows the value in the strip (that is the default) and label_parsed, which is used for showing mathematical expressions in strip labels (e.g. greek letters, exponents etc.). For more information on customizing facet strip lables, visit this link(). Note: I made a package called ggsim, yet another extension of ggplot2 with a few functions coming handy for simulation data. One of the functions, facettize, is aimed at making your life easier when labelling the strips of your facets (i.e. not going into the nitty gritty of the labeller function), especially when some facets include parsing mathematical expressions. Feel free to install it from GitHub by using: devtools::install_github(&quot;rscherrer/ggsim&quot;) 5.6 The right format for the dataset One question that may come to your mind is: what is the right format of a dataset for use in ggplot, especially since it is part of the tidyverse? The answer is: it depends, and this is where the intergration with other tidyverse tools makes our live easier. If, for example, we want to use a variable for facetting or as an aesthetics, it is important to have this variable as a single column. For example, in the original data dataset, we could have compared the optical density between the two time point: ggplot(data, aes(x = time, y = OD600)) + geom_violin() However, if we want to plot the optical density of time point 1 versus that of time point 0, then we need these two time points in separate columns, which is exactly what OD600_T0 and OD600_T1, in the data2 dataset, are: ggplot(data2, aes(x = OD600_T0, y = OD600_T1)) + geom_point() 5.6.1 Plotting as part of a pipeline What we just saw means that sometimes reformating of a dataset is needed (e.g. using pivot_longer or pivot_wider from tidyr) to get this one plot done that requires it. If reformatting and storing into a whole new data frame is too cumbersome for a single plot, one can use ggplot as final part of a tidyverse pipeline in which the data is being reformatted. For example, starting from the original data: data %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from = &quot;time&quot;, values_from = c(&quot;cfu&quot;, &quot;OD600&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = OD600_T0, y = OD600_T1)) + geom_point() Notice the use of the pipe %&gt;% to pass the resulting data frame on to the ggplot command. Because ggplot is called with a pipe, its first argument is already passed (it is the data frame coming through the pipe), so we only need to pass the second argument, the aesthetics mapping, to the ggplot function. 5.7 Customization Now that we saw everything there is to know about structuring a ggplot, it is time to learn how to polish it (the easiest and most rewarding part!). 5.7.1 Scales Every aesthetics can be scaled. This includes specifying what values an aesthetics can take (e.g. what colors to pick, or what range of transparencies to use) or possible break points along the legend. Use the scale_* family of functions for that. There are many such functions, because many aesthetics can be modified, but the logic behind their naming is always the same: scale_&lt;AESTHETIC&gt;_&lt;TYPE&gt; where &lt;AESTHETIC&gt; is replaced by the aesthetic you want to scale (e.g. color, size, alpha) and &lt;TYPE&gt; is the type of variable that is mapped to this aesthetic (common types are continuous, discrete and manual). Some scaling functions do not take a &lt;TYPE&gt; but just an &lt;AESTHETIC&gt; in their name, e.g. scale_alpha. In our example, if we color-code points according to their strain, which is a categorical variable, we can use scale_color_manual (aka scale_colour_manual) to manually pick the colors we want: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = strain)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + # just to spice up our use of geoms facet_grid(strain ~ assay) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;forestgreen&quot;, &quot;goldenrod&quot;, &quot;mediumseagreen&quot;)) Alternatively, we could color-code the points based on their number of CFU at time point T1, cfu_T1, which is a continuous variable, using scale_color_continuous. Without scaling: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = cfu_T1)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + # just to spice up our use of geoms facet_grid(strain ~ assay) With scaling: ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = cfu_T1)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(strain ~ assay) + scale_color_continuous(type = &quot;viridis&quot;) The arguments that are taken by the scale_ function really depend on the use case, e.g. scale_color_manual expects discrete values, scale_color_continuous expects a type of built-in continuous color gradient, and scale_color_gradient expects a low and high color boundaries (and also a mid-gradient color in the case of scale_color_gradient2). But the logic shown here is similar across many aesthetics, e.g. scale_alpha_continuous and scale_size_continuous work in similar ways, but then taking a range argument. So, lots of scaling functions to play with, and we do not provide an exhaustive list here. Mandatory aesthetics, such as x and y, also have their scaling functions. If x or y is continuous, one can e.g. use scale_x_log10 to show this axis on a logarithmic scale, without having to log-tansform the data before plotting, e.g. ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = cfu_T1)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(strain ~ assay) + scale_color_continuous(type = &quot;viridis&quot;) + scale_x_log10() 5.7.2 Labels The functions ggtitle, xlab, ylab and labs allow you to customize the labels shown for each aesthetics (remember that the x- and y-axes are aesthetics too), and for the main title of the plot. On to a full-fledge example: p &lt;- ggplot(data2, aes(x = conc, y = ratio, color = cfu_T1)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(strain ~ assay) + scale_color_continuous(type = &quot;viridis&quot;) + scale_x_log10() + xlab(&quot;Nisin concentration (mmol/mL)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Mutational ratio&quot;) + labs(color = parse(text = &quot;&#39;CFU at &#39;~T[1]&quot;)) + # plotmath expression ggtitle( &quot;A very important experiment&quot;, &quot;So important it deserves a subtitle&quot; ) p Note that xlab and ylab are wrappers around labs, meaning that we could have provided labs with x = ... and y = ... in addition to color = ..., its arguments just need to take the names of the aesthetics. If you want no labels, use e.g. xlab(NULL) or ylab(NULL). Also notice the use of parse to display mathemetical notations using the plotmath syntax. This is not part of the tidyverse though, so it is a story for another day, feel free to look it up! 5.7.3 Themes You may be already frustrated that all plots have this same grey default ggplot2 background. Of course, it is possible to change this too by playing with the theme functions. There are other built-in themes than the default grey one, such as theme_bw or theme_classic: p + theme_classic() p + theme_bw() The individual elements of the theme, e.g. the background grid or the color of the panel, can be customized using the arguments in the theme function. The theme function can also be used to modify stuff related to the legend or the axes of the plots. For example: p &lt;- p + theme_bw() + theme( legend.position = &quot;left&quot;, axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1) ) p Here, legend.position is sort of self-explanatory, but axis.text.x is a bit more subtle. Some elements of the theme, such as the text of the axes, need a series of graphical parameters in order to be modified, and the graphical parameters that can be used depend on the type of object those theme elements are (are they text, rect or line?). We use the element_* family of functions to pass those graphical parameters to our theme elements of interest. Here, we use element_text to transform the text on the x-axis by rotating it by an angle of 60 degrees, and then align each label to the right (hjust stands for “horizontal justification”). Again, lots of combinations are possible. Explore! 5.7.4 Custom legend The one thing I Google the most, without a doubt, is “custom legend in ggplot”, because I always forget how to choose which legend to show, e.g. if I want to display the color legend but not the alpha legend. So here it is: to hide all the legends, use: p + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) And to selectively hide some legends, use guides: p + guides(color = FALSE) Want more? Do like me and visit over and over this page (link). 5.8 Combining plots This was more or less what you need to know to be operational when plotting single ggplots. But what if the facetting option is not enough, and you want to combine actual multiple plots into a single figure? ggplot2 itself does not do that, but the good news is, there are many packages that do it. Those include patchwork, cowplot, grid, gridExtra, egg or aplot (and probably more). One term that these packages often use is grob. A grob is a ggplot-like object, such as a ggplot but could also be a single a single text label in the middle of a plotting window. These packages essentially assemble grobs together. patchwork is personally my favorite so I will focus on this one here. It has the advantage to automatically align the frames of the different plots across the different subplots. It also has an excellent, succinct documentation. Let us look at an example, where we assign the previous plot to p1 and make a new plot to combine it with, called p2: p1 &lt;- p p2 &lt;- ggplot(data2, aes(x = strain, y = OD600_T1, color = strain)) + geom_violin(draw_quantiles = 0.5) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + theme_classic() + xlab(NULL) + ylab(parse(text = &quot;&#39;Optial density at 600nm at&#39;~T[1]&quot;)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) p2 In patchwork, we would combine both using: library(patchwork) p1 + p2 patchwork uses operators such as +, / or | to assemble the plots in various layouts. It looks simple, but a caveat of this approach is that it may become tedious when assembling, e.g. 15 small plots, or plots from a list of unknown length. The programmatic equivalent of the above example is: wrap_plots(p1, p2) # or even more programmatic, wrap_plots(list(p1, p2)) More customization can be added to the previous combination of plots, such as layout specifications, e.g. controlling the position and dimension of the different plots, or annotations, e.g. global title, labelling each plot or capturing the legends of all the plots and show it as one global legend). But this is a ggplot2 tutorial and we just want you to know that patchwork and friends exist, so go there to know more about what they can do! 5.9 Saving a plot Last but not least, ggplots have their own saving function: ggsave (it also works on combinations of ggplots made by patchwork or cowplot), which guesses the extension of your figure (e.g. .png or .pdf) from the file name you provide. You can also given it specific width, height and dpi (resolution – journals like 300dpi I’ve heard) parameter values. 5.10 High throughput plotting workflow As we mentioned in the part about combining plots, sometimes we want to do things many times (in my case I often make 100 times the same figure, just for different replicate simulations). Of course we would not copy and paste many times the same snippet of code, or write 100 times + to assemble some plots (by now we are advanced R users, after all). This is where we can make use, again, of the combination of tidyverse tools, and especially purrr. Let us make a function that plots the number of CFU against the optical density, facetted by time point (so, that function expects a time point-wise dataset, such as data): plot_this &lt;- function(data) { ggplot(data, aes(x = OD600, y = cfu, color = cfu)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(. ~ time) + theme_classic() + scale_color_continuous(type = &quot;viridis&quot;) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) + xlab(parse(text = &quot;&#39;Optical density at 600nm at&#39;~T[1]&quot;)) + ylab(&quot;CFU&quot;) } The objective is to apply this function to each strain-assay combination, thus getting one plot per combination. We can check that this function works as expected for a single combination using our friend dplyr: data %&gt;% filter(strain == &quot;control&quot;, assay == &quot;test 1&quot;) %&gt;% plot_this() which works because plot_this takes a data frame as first argument. Now that we are happy with out single-plot function, we use purrr to nest our data frame into all the relevant combinations of strain and assay, and we map through the resulting list-column to produce many ggplots in one go: newdata &lt;- data %&gt;% group_by(assay, strain) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% mutate(fig = map(data, plot_this)) newdata #&gt; # A tibble: 6 x 4 #&gt; # Groups: strain, assay [6] #&gt; strain assay data fig #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt; #&gt; 1 strain 1 test 1 &lt;tibble [72 × 5]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; #&gt; 2 control test 1 &lt;tibble [48 × 5]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; #&gt; 3 strain 2 test 1 &lt;tibble [48 × 5]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; #&gt; 4 strain 2 test 2 &lt;tibble [46 × 5]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; #&gt; 5 strain 1 test 2 &lt;tibble [48 × 5]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; #&gt; 6 control test 2 &lt;tibble [48 × 5]&gt; &lt;gg&gt; where the new list-column fig is a list of ggplot objects, that we can check individually: newdata$fig[[1]] purrrfect. If you ask yourself why going through this hassle whith only two assays and three strains, just think about a case where you would have hundreds of e.g. simulations, sequences, field sites or study species. Let us go a bit further. Now we want to combine plots for each strain into one figure per assay. We also want to give the resulting combined plot a figure file name, and save all the figures. There we go: newdata &lt;- newdata %&gt;% select(-data) %&gt;% # just to clean up a bit group_by(assay) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% mutate(combifig = map(data, ~ wrap_plots(.x$fig))) newdata #&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 3 #&gt; # Groups: assay [2] #&gt; assay data combifig #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt; #&gt; 1 test 1 &lt;tibble [3 × 2]&gt; &lt;patchwrk&gt; #&gt; 2 test 2 &lt;tibble [3 × 2]&gt; &lt;patchwrk&gt; Note that we use the formula-way of passing functions to map, which is more succinct than the lambda way (function(x) wrap_plots(x)), and where .x is interpreted as an element of the list we iterate through (here the list-column data). Please refer to the purrr documentation for more details. As we can see, we have created a new list-column combifig, filled with patchwork objects: newdata$combifig[[1]] We could of course further customize the assembly of plots, but we refer the reader to the patchwork documentation for this. Last step, preparing file names and saving the figures, using other old friends from the tidyverse: library(glue) newdata %&gt;% mutate(figname = glue(&quot;data/figure_{str_replace(assay, &#39; &#39;, &#39;_&#39;)}.png&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(saved = walk2(figname, combifig, ggsave)) #&gt; # A tibble: 2 x 5 #&gt; # Groups: assay [2] #&gt; assay data combifig figname saved #&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;glue&gt; &lt;glue&gt; #&gt; 1 test 1 &lt;tibble [3 × 2]&gt; &lt;patchwrk&gt; data/figure_test_1.p… data/figure_test_1.p… #&gt; 2 test 2 &lt;tibble [3 × 2]&gt; &lt;patchwrk&gt; data/figure_test_2.p… data/figure_test_2.p… 5.11 Want more? ggplot2 is undoubtedly one of the largest chunks of the tidyverse. Here we tried to provide a global understanding of how it works, but we could not dig into all possible functions it has (this would take us days). Hopefully now you are armed with the necessary knowledge to be able to find the missing pieces you need. Some things, however, are missing from ggplot2. Fortunately, there are literally tons of extensions building on ggplot2 that respect the same grammar. Some of them implement new geoms (e.g. such as ggridges for ridge-density plots, ggradar for radial plots, or gghalves for mixes of geoms), others combine plots (examples cited above), allow more complex themes (e.g. ggnewscale for multiple scales of the same type to coexist, or ggdark for a dark background), deal with complicated objects that are not trivial to fit in data frames (e.g. ggtree for tree-like objects or ggraph for networks), or provide shortcuts to quickly produce publication-ready figures for common plot layouts and their corresponding statistical analyses (e.g. ggpubr or ggrapid). There are even packages for animated graphics (gganimate), interactive plot building (esquisse) or 3D and surface plotting (rayshader).
