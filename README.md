# [TRES Tidyverse Tutorial](https://pratikunterwegs.github.io/tres-tidy-tutorial/)

This is the source code for the TRES [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) tutorial.
The readable version can be accessed by clicking the page title above.

## About

The TRES tidyverse tutorial is an online workshop on how to use the tidyverse, a set of packages in the R computing language designed at making data handling and plotting easier. 

This tutorial will take the form of a one hour per week video stream via Google Meet, every Friday morning at 10.00 (Groningen time) starting from the 29th of May, 2020 and lasting for a couple of weeks (depending on the number of topics we want to cover, but there should be at least 5). 

**PhD students from outside our department are welcome to attend.**
